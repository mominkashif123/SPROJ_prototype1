    "Answers": "The painter has made the British officer the largest figure to demonstrate the importance that they held in India. Similarly the Indians are shown as small people to reflect their lowly status; Local rulers are on horseback behind the British official. They are shown as smaller,\nreflecting their lower status to the British; The horses are shown as large animals, graceful in appearance and movement, again\nshowing superiority and power. This is reinforced by soldiers on horses who were carrying\nweapons; The East India Company is shown as being a wealthy organisation as seen in the uniforms\nand the decorations on the horses. The Company were able to achieve this wealth through\ntrading as can be seen by the boat shown in the picture and through the gaining of lands\nthrough conquest and agreements with local rulers. This is shown by the weapons displayed\nand the wealthy appearance of the Indians that the British were also able to exploit"

    "Question": "(c) Why were the British able to take control of India by 1850?",
    "Marks": 7,
    "Answers": "The British built a huge network of roads and later railways that meant that communication and transport links between cities became better, soldiers could travel much more easily from trouble spot to trouble spot. It also benefitted British trading links which in turn produced more wealth. The battles of Plassey and Buxar also gave the British the vast riches of Bengal and favourable trading rights with the local nawabs. This provided massive new resources which Britain could use to consolidate its control. The British also introduced governorgenerals into the provinces who administered them on British lines and provided yet more control. The British army using its vast local resources and superior weapons and skills were increasingly taking control of more land."

    "Question": "(d) Was the work of the Christian missionaries the most important reason why the Indians",
    "Marks": 10,
    "Answers": "Christian missionaries came to India to convert the local population as well as to set up\nschools. In these schools the missionaries taught Christianity and expected local religions to\nbe given up which was resented by Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs alike.\nHowever, there were other reasons why the Indians opposed the British attempts to\nwesternise them. The replacement of Persian and Sanskrit by English as the official\nlanguage in the 1830s deeply upset both the Muslims and Hindus. This had the potential to\nthreaten their languages. A number of social reforms had been imposed by the British\nwithout consultation or care for local feeling which caused much unrest. Indians had to send\ntheir children to co-educational schools which was hated since it appeared to impose the\nBritish system on the Indians without due regard to their religious and cultural feelings.\nThomas Macaulay believed that European ideas of education were vastly superior to\nanything coming out of India and, as a result, the British imposed a system of education that\npromoted western values on a people who resented this interference. They were also forced\nto abandon purdha which had been an Indian custom for centuries. In 1795 the killing of\nbaby daughters was declared to be murder, but the British found difficulty in enforcing this as\nit was again a tradition practised in many parts of India. Suttee, the ritual burning of Indian\nwomen on the funeral pyres of their husbands was also banned by the British, first in Bengal\nand then in the rest of the country. Although the British had been reluctant to get involved in\nbanning this practice, there was little opposition to the outlawing of it."

He won important victories against the British in the\nSecond Anglo-Mysore War, and negotiated the 1784 Treaty of Mangalore with them after his\nfather died the previous year. His treatment of his conquered non-Muslim subjects and\nBritish prisoners of war is controversial. He remained an enemy of the British, bringing them\ninto renewed conflict with an attack on Travancore in 1789. In the Third Anglo-Mysore War,\nTipu was forced into a humiliating treaty, losing a number of previously conquered territories,\nincluding Malabar and Mangalore. In the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, the combined forces of\nthe British and the Nizam of Hyderabad defeated Tipu and he was killed on 4 May 1799,\nwhile defending his fort of Srirangapatna."

    "Answers": "He suggested that the British should try to understand Muslims better. He gave an\nexplanation of the word ‘Nadarath’ in an attempt to remove the misunderstanding of the\nBritish about the Muslims. He believed that relations with the British could be improved by\nimproving the understanding of Christianity by Muslims. He tried to overcome this by writing\nTabyin-ul-Kalam, in which he pointed out the similarities between Islam and Christianity. He\nwrote a number of books following the War of Independence in which he tried to show the\nBritish that the Muslims were only partly to blame and that there were many who were\nsupporters of the British government. He was also aware that the British knew little about\nIslam and was offended by a book he read in Britain on the life of the Prophet and, as a\nresult, he wrote his own work correcting the many errors he had read.\nHowever, he contributed many other things. Sir Syed wanted democratic rights in India but\nbelieved that this would only disadvantage Muslims since Hindus were in the majority and\nwould win all the elections. He therefore felt that the British should treat the Muslims and\nHindus differently since they lived separate and different lives from one another and so were\nreally like separate nations. Sir Syed was the first person to express this point of view and it\nbecame known as the Two Nation Theory that gave hope to Muslims of a separate\nhomeland. He attempted to improve the position of Muslims through education. In 1863 he\nfounded the Scientific Society at Ghazipore. He wanted to make scientific writings available\nto Muslims by translating them from English into Urdu. He established a Muslim college\nwhich led to the Muslim-Anglo Oriental College in 1876. This became the University of\nAligarh which became important in Pakistani history as providing an education for many of its\nfuture leaders"

Pakistan discovered\nthat Indians had been there and decided to defend its interests before India claimed the\nglacier, especially as the border in that part of Kashmir had never been drawn properly.\nWhen Pakistan soldiers moved up to the glacier they discovered 300 Indian troops there.\nThis meant that both sets of troops had to stay there as the glacier was an important symbol\nto both sides. Pakistan tried several times to remove the Indian troops from there without\nsuccess. In 1987 Musharraf led one of these assaults. In 1989 Bhutto visited the glacier to\nreinforce Pakistan’s view of it. No official figures exist of the death toll on the glacier with\nestimates between 3000 and 5000, but many of these have probably been due to\navalanches and falls.

It also safeguarded the interests\nof minority provinces which now had equal status in the Senate. He produced the 1973\nConstitution in an attempt to return to a form of parliamentary democracy and it was\nimportant since it is the basis upon which Pakistan has been governed to the end of the 20th\ncentury, apart from when it was suspended due to martial law.\nHe also tried to improve the infant mortality and age expectancy rates by introducing Rural\nHealth Centres and Basic Health Units. Pharmaceutical companies were banned from\ncharging for a particular medical brand name and so medicines became cheaper.\nAmongst Bhutto’s education reforms, free primary education was introduced. New schools\nwere to be built and all private sector schools were nationalised. The aim was to increase the\nliteracy rate and raise academic standards. One of the main weaknesses of the new constitution was that the focal point of political\npower lay with the party leadership and Bhutto in particular. When things went wrong, Bhutto\nwas blamed.\nBanning pharmaceutical companies from charging for a medical brand and making\nmedicines cheaper did see the profits of chemists fall drastically and as a result many\ninternational drug companies closed down their operations in Pakistan.\nThe changes in education led to overcrowding in existing schools while new ones were built.\nThe reforms were not very successful since the building of new schools and the recruitment\nof new teachers could not be achieved quickly and was also very expensive. Many families\nresented the reforms since it meant a loss of earnings for them."

However they did invade the Empire a number of\ntimes during the 18th Century.\nThe Persians under Nadir Shah captured much of the Empire’s wealth\nand returned home with gold, jewels and the Peacock throne from Delhi.\nAurangzeb often showed intolerance to non-Muslims.

    "Marks": 14,
    "Answers": "It was an important meeting as Gandhi had been forced to negotiate with\nthe Muslim League on an equal footing for the first time regarding the\nfuture of India.\nGandhi wanted to achieve independence first – partition discussions\ncould follow later – whereas Jinnah wanted to settle the issue of partition\nfirst and before the British left. He knew that his bargaining position would\nbe much weaker if he went along with Gandhi’s plan. The Lahore Resolution, 1940 drafted by the 25-man All-India Muslim\nLeague asked for greater Muslim autonomy within India; this was seen as\na demand for a separate Muslim state. From then on, the aims of the\nMuslim League were clear: an independent nation state.\nThe results of the 1945–46 elections demonstrated that Congress had\ncontrol of the non-Muslim votes but that the League had gained control of\nthe Muslim vote. The Muslim League was now an equal player to\nCongress so the demand for Partition could no longer be ignored by\nCongress or the British government.\nIn March 1946, members of the British Cabinet Mission arrived in India to\nwork out a plan for achieving independence for India as a federation\nwhich the Muslim League accepted but Congress refused to accept the\nprovince groupings and stated that they would not be bound by any\nBritish plan. The British government decided to form an interim\ngovernment headed by Nehru joined by members of the Muslim League.\nAs the Muslim League were concerned that the British would leave India\nwithout organising a settlement and that Congress would be left to\norganise a new country, they organised a Direct Action Day in the\nsummer of 1946 with the aim of stopping the British government giving in\nto Congress. The disruption worried the British, so gradually they shifted\ntheir position on Partition."

Lord Cornwallis introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793 making\nzamindars of Bengal landowners, subject to their payment of a fixed\nsum to the British. In 1793 this amounted to some 10% of the total sum\ncollected by the zamindars. The Permanent Settlement secured the\nfinancial interest of the East India Company and helped Bengal to\nbecome the wealthiest province in India, allowing the British to extend\ntheir control.\nLocal rulers were persuaded to sign subsidiary alliances by Lord\nWellesley who became Governor General in 1798.

To reverse the decline in\nMuslim power he taught that there needed to be spiritual and moral\nregeneration based upon the principles of Islam.\nHe encouraged the Muslim community to concentrate on Quranic\nteachings and translated the Holy Quran into Persian, which was the\nmain language of Muslim groups at that time.\nHe wrote many books, which were designed to spread the principles of\nIslam amongst the Muslim community in order to unite them.

He tried to\novercome this by writing Tabyin-ul-Kalam, in which he pointed out the\nsimilarities between Islam and Christianity.\nHe was also aware that the British knew little about Islam. After reading\na book in Britain on the life of the Prophet, he wrote his own work\ncorrecting the many errors he had read. In 1863 he founded the Scientific Society at Ghazipore. He wanted to\nmake scientific writings available to Muslims by translating them from\nEnglish into Urdu.\nHe established a Muslim college, which led to the Muslim-Anglo Oriental\nCollege in 1876. This became the University of Aligarh, which became\nimportant as it educated many future leaders.\nImproving the position of the Muslim community in society through\nencouraging a Western education. He recognised that the Muslim community could not win any election\nbecause of the Hindu majority population, so he advocated separate\nseats and a separate electorate, which was the forerunner of the future\ndemand for a separate homeland.\nHis books following the War of Independence attempted to restore\nBritish understanding about the Muslim community. He showed that\nthere were Muslim supporters of the British government. He gave\nexplanation of the word ‘Nadarath’ and suggested that the British should\ntry to understand Muslim groups better. Sir Syed was concerned that the Hindu community demanded that Hindi\nshould be made the official language in 1867 in place of Urdu. He\nbecame opposed to the way that Congress was working for the interests\nof Hindus in a way that was detrimental to the Muslim community. This\nled to the formation of the United Patriotic Alliance.\nSir Syed emphasised this threat to the Muslim community and\ndeveloped his Two Nation Theory, as a result many Muslim groups\ncalled him the ‘Father of the Pakistan Movement’."

Muslims were forbidden to\neat beef and received harsh punishments if they slaughtered cows.\nHindi was enforced as the official language and organised attacks were\nmade on mosques.

It was introduced in all schools and\ncolleges. It promoted Hindu myths and heroes, adopting them as\nnational icons. Muslim groups felt it was an attempt to subvert their\nfaith.\nThe Wardha scheme was a new educational policy that required\nstudents to bow before Gandhi’s picture each day.

    "Marks": 14,
    "Answers": "Moplahs were deeply religious Muslims who rose up against their\nHindu landlords and the British in South India. Their activities\ndestroyed a police station and Hindu property. This action divided\nHindus and Muslims and put in doubt Hindu cooperation in the Khilafat\nMovement. 18 000 Muslim people migrated to Afghanistan (hijrat) to protect and\nfoster Islam after a promise of homes and land. However the Afghan\ngovernment did not welcome the hijrats and refused many of them\nentry. Many of those returning to India died on the journey back or they\nfound themselves homeless and their jobs occupied. This was\ndispiriting for the Muslim community and support for the Khilafat\nMovement was lost.\nSome of the leaders including Maulana and Muhammad Ali were\nimprisoned in 1921, which made the organisation less effective.\nGandhi had seen an opportunity for self-rule by joining the Movement\nand the involvement of the Hindu community was initially welcomed by\nmany Muslims. However, this made the objectives of the Movement\nless clear since it was felt that Hindu groups and Gandhi were using it\nto advance their own interests, not those of the Muslim community.\nThe Chauri Chaura incident of violence between protesters and the\npolice led Gandhi to withdraw his support from the Khilafat Movement.\nThis left Muslim groups to continue the work of the Movement alone\nwhich, combined with the imprisonment of their leaders and the Hijrat,\nwas challenging.\nThe end of the Movement was also brought about by the decision of\nthe Muslim Mustafa Kamal Ataturk to form a nationalist government in\nTurkey. Muslim groups now had no cause to follow."
