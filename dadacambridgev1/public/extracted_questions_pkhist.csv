The Nawab didn’t cover their cannon and muskets when it rained.
English soldiers knew how to prepare for battle in the rain better.
Nawab’s muskets were useless due to the wet powder.
Mir Jafar’s men unwilling to fight against the British.
Jafar had turned traitor/been corrupted by the British.
Nawab had 500 casualties to Clive’s 22.
It was raining.
The Nawab’s troops retreated."
2015,Section A,Kashmir Dispute,(b) What does Source B tell us about the British East India Company in 1825?,5,"The painter has made the British officer the largest figure to demonstrate the importance that they held in India. Similarly the Indians are shown as small people to reflect their lowly status; Local rulers are on horseback behind the British official. They are shown as smaller,
reflecting their lower status to the British; The horses are shown as large animals, graceful in appearance and movement, again
showing superiority and power. This is reinforced by soldiers on horses who were carrying
weapons; The East India Company is shown as being a wealthy organisation as seen in the uniforms
and the decorations on the horses. The Company were able to achieve this wealth through
trading as can be seen by the boat shown in the picture and through the gaining of lands
through conquest and agreements with local rulers. This is shown by the weapons displayed
and the wealthy appearance of the Indians that the British were also able to exploit"
2015,Section A,Kashmir Dispute,(c) Why were the British able to take control of India by 1850?,7,"The British built a huge network of roads and later railways that meant that communication and transport links between cities became better, soldiers could travel much more easily from trouble spot to trouble spot. It also benefitted British trading links which in turn produced more wealth. The battles of Plassey and Buxar also gave the British the vast riches of Bengal and favourable trading rights with the local nawabs. This provided massive new resources which Britain could use to consolidate its control. The British also introduced governorgenerals into the provinces who administered them on British lines and provided yet more control. The British army using its vast local resources and superior weapons and skills were increasingly taking control of more land."
2015,Section A,Kashmir Dispute,(d) Was the work of the Christian missionaries the most important reason why the Indians,10,"Christian missionaries came to India to convert the local population as well as to set up
schools. In these schools the missionaries taught Christianity and expected local religions to
be given up which was resented by Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs alike.
However, there were other reasons why the Indians opposed the British attempts to
westernise them. The replacement of Persian and Sanskrit by English as the official
language in the 1830s deeply upset both the Muslims and Hindus. This had the potential to
threaten their languages. A number of social reforms had been imposed by the British
without consultation or care for local feeling which caused much unrest. Indians had to send
their children to co-educational schools which was hated since it appeared to impose the
British system on the Indians without due regard to their religious and cultural feelings.
Thomas Macaulay believed that European ideas of education were vastly superior to
anything coming out of India and, as a result, the British imposed a system of education that
promoted western values on a people who resented this interference. They were also forced
to abandon purdha which had been an Indian custom for centuries. In 1795 the killing of
baby daughters was declared to be murder, but the British found difficulty in enforcing this as
it was again a tradition practised in many parts of India. Suttee, the ritual burning of Indian
women on the funeral pyres of their husbands was also banned by the British, first in Bengal
and then in the rest of the country. Although the British had been reluctant to get involved in
banning this practice, there was little opposition to the outlawing of it. "
2015,Section B,General History,(a) Who was Tipu Sultan?,4,"Son of Haider Ali of Mysore, both of whom resisted British rule. Tipu received support from
the French and the British were concerned about this. He was known as the Tiger of Mysore
and ruled there from 1782 to 1799. He won important victories against the British in the
Second Anglo-Mysore War, and negotiated the 1784 Treaty of Mangalore with them after his
father died the previous year. His treatment of his conquered non-Muslim subjects and
British prisoners of war is controversial. He remained an enemy of the British, bringing them
into renewed conflict with an attack on Travancore in 1789. In the Third Anglo-Mysore War,
Tipu was forced into a humiliating treaty, losing a number of previously conquered territories,
including Malabar and Mangalore. In the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, the combined forces of
the British and the Nizam of Hyderabad defeated Tipu and he was killed on 4 May 1799,
while defending his fort of Srirangapatna. "
2015,Section B,Independence and Partition,(b) Why was Urdu chosen as the national language in Pakistan in 1947?,7,"It carries immense importance for all Pakistanis since it has been considered to be the
language of all Muslims for 300 years. It was the language associated with the Pakistani
Movement throughout its struggle with the British and the Hindus. After Independence, it was
felt that the language was the uniting force behind the nation and the government is
committed to using it at all levels in society. "
2015,Section B,General History,(c) Was the attempt to achieve a better understanding with the British the most important century? Explain your answer.,14,"He suggested that the British should try to understand Muslims better. He gave an
explanation of the word ‘Nadarath’ in an attempt to remove the misunderstanding of the
British about the Muslims. He believed that relations with the British could be improved by
improving the understanding of Christianity by Muslims. He tried to overcome this by writing
Tabyin-ul-Kalam, in which he pointed out the similarities between Islam and Christianity. He
wrote a number of books following the War of Independence in which he tried to show the
British that the Muslims were only partly to blame and that there were many who were
supporters of the British government. He was also aware that the British knew little about
Islam and was offended by a book he read in Britain on the life of the Prophet and, as a
result, he wrote his own work correcting the many errors he had read.
However, he contributed many other things. Sir Syed wanted democratic rights in India but
believed that this would only disadvantage Muslims since Hindus were in the majority and
would win all the elections. He therefore felt that the British should treat the Muslims and
Hindus differently since they lived separate and different lives from one another and so were
really like separate nations. Sir Syed was the first person to express this point of view and it
became known as the Two Nation Theory that gave hope to Muslims of a separate
homeland. He attempted to improve the position of Muslims through education. In 1863 he
founded the Scientific Society at Ghazipore. He wanted to make scientific writings available
to Muslims by translating them from English into Urdu. He established a Muslim college
which led to the Muslim-Anglo Oriental College in 1876. This became the University of
Aligarh which became important in Pakistani history as providing an education for many of its
future leaders"
2015,Section B,Khilafat & Non-Cooperation Movement,(a) What was the All India Khilafat Conference?,4,"Held in Delhi in November 1919, led by Ali brothers who hoped to try and persuade the
British to keep their promises about maintaining the Turkish Empire. Maulana Abul Kalam
Azad and Gandhi represented Congress. Gandhi hoped to unite Hindus and Muslims in his
non-violent campaign against the British. Azad warned the Conference that David Lloyd
George intended to punish Turkey for fighting against Britain in the war. The Conference
passed a resolution agreeing to send a delegation to Britain, making sure they were aware of
the strength of Muslim support for the Khalifa. "
2015,Section B,Jinnah's 14 Points,(b) Why did Jinnah produce his 14 Points in 1929?,7,"The 14 Points set out the demands of any future negotiations with either Congress or the
British Government. The 14 Points also formed the basis of the Muslims’ demands for a
separate homeland. It also convinced them that the Hindus and Muslims were two separate
nations."
2015,Section B,General History,(c) How successful were the three Round Table Conferences of 1930-1932? Explain your answer.,14,The federal system for India was approved. Sind was given a separate identity and a government. Congress was attended. Minorities entered into an agreement on their demands. Congress was boycotted. There was a deadlock on the federal system. The minorities sub-committee couldn’t reach a conclusion. Gandhi took a hard line and refused to recognize the problems of the minorities. Muslims took a hard line against Congress to protect their position. The British National government was less keen to reach a compromise in India. Congress was absent again. The gulf between the two sides was too great.
2015,Section B,General History,(a) What was the ‘Afghan Miracle’?,4,"USSR’s invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 led to an immediate impact on Pakistan’s
relationship with other countries. Zia was seen as leader of a Muslim nation on the frontline
against communist forces. Economic and military support came from the West and Pakistan
became an important base against the Soviets. Pakistan became a leading country in world
politics and this led to huge sums of money coming into the country to pay for the care of
refugees and the armed forces. Zia was able to use some of the funds to make economic
progress and reform the economy. "
2015,Section B,General History,(b) Why was Islamabad chosen as the new capital of Pakistan?,7,"Government officials would be moved well away from the commercial districts of Karachi that
might have some unwanted influences on them. It was also seen as an appropriate
movement of the power base from the industrially and commercially developed south to the
underdeveloped Punjab region in the north. Ayub Khan wanted to be closer to the army’s
command headquarters in the north which he saw as vital in times of martial law. Karachi
had a very warm and humid climate and, as a port, it wasn’t felt that it represented the needs
of a capital city as the existing buildings were not adequate in number or up to the standards
required by a capital. The layout and structure of the existing port city did not allow it to take
on the functions of a modern capital. With its position on the coast, it was considered
vulnerable to attacks from the Arabian Sea. The vast influx of refugees intensified the
existing problems and created new ones. "
2015,Section B,Independence and Partition,(c) How successful was Pakistan in its relationship with the U.S.A. between 1947 and 1999? Explain your answer.,14,"Liaquat Ali Khan visits the United States. Pakistan is willing to join the US in an anti-communism pact in return for military aid. Pakistan joins SEATO and CENTO. Substantial military and economic aid is provided to Pakistan, amounting to $4.2 billion, making it the third highest recipient of US aid. Bhutto visits the US. Clinton restores sales of aircraft in return for Pakistan stopping the production of weapons-grade uranium. Bhutto visits the US and gains $388 million in military equipment. First Lady Hillary Clinton visits Pakistan. The US provides military aid to India during its war with China, placing strain on relations. Pakistan turns to China for friendship. The US places an arms embargo on India and Pakistan during their war, badly affecting Pakistan. Bhutto leaves SEATO. American aid is suspended and later suspended again. US aid falls dramatically, creating problems for Benazir Bhutto. US President George Bush blocks aid to Pakistan due to nuclear weapons. The US comes close to declaring Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism and places economic sanctions on the country. The US condemns Pakistan’s nuclear weapons tests."
2015,Section B,Kashmir Dispute,(a) What has been the importance of the Siachen Glacier to both India and Pakistan?,4,"1977 Indian colonel Kumar first climbed the glacier. Returned in 1981. Pakistan discovered
that Indians had been there and decided to defend its interests before India claimed the
glacier, especially as the border in that part of Kashmir had never been drawn properly.
When Pakistan soldiers moved up to the glacier they discovered 300 Indian troops there.
This meant that both sets of troops had to stay there as the glacier was an important symbol
to both sides. Pakistan tried several times to remove the Indian troops from there without
success. In 1987 Musharraf led one of these assaults. In 1989 Bhutto visited the glacier to
reinforce Pakistan’s view of it. No official figures exist of the death toll on the glacier with
estimates between 3000 and 5000, but many of these have probably been due to
avalanches and falls. No settlement has been reached, even though several meetings have
been held to discuss the situation since 1989. "
2015,Section B,General History,(b) Explain why General Musharraf was able to gain power in 1999.,7,"Sharif was giving support for the Taliban in Afghanistan and this damaged relations with USA
as they refused to hand over Osama bin Laden, suspected of bombing of US embassy in
Kenya. Pakistan also tested nuclear weapons which angered a number of countries which
then halted aid to Pakistan and brought Sharif much criticism. He also blamed Musharraf for
the embarrassing retreat from the fighting in Kashmir. The army refused to accept this
criticism. Sharif tried to sack Musharraf whilst he was visiting Sri Lanka and as a result the
army decided to intervene in the government and overthrew Sharif. "
2015,Section B,Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto,(c) How successful were Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto’s domestic policies between 1971 and 1977? Explain your answer.,14,"A new constitution drawn up in 1973 established a Senate which offered the opportunity for
professionals, academics and specialists to work together. It also safeguarded the interests
of minority provinces which now had equal status in the Senate. He produced the 1973
Constitution in an attempt to return to a form of parliamentary democracy and it was
important since it is the basis upon which Pakistan has been governed to the end of the 20th
century, apart from when it was suspended due to martial law.
He also tried to improve the infant mortality and age expectancy rates by introducing Rural
Health Centres and Basic Health Units. Pharmaceutical companies were banned from
charging for a particular medical brand name and so medicines became cheaper.
Amongst Bhutto’s education reforms, free primary education was introduced. New schools
were to be built and all private sector schools were nationalised. The aim was to increase the
literacy rate and raise academic standards. One of the main weaknesses of the new constitution was that the focal point of political
power lay with the party leadership and Bhutto in particular. When things went wrong, Bhutto
was blamed.
Banning pharmaceutical companies from charging for a medical brand and making
medicines cheaper did see the profits of chemists fall drastically and as a result many
international drug companies closed down their operations in Pakistan.
The changes in education led to overcrowding in existing schools while new ones were built.
The reforms were not very successful since the building of new schools and the recruitment
of new teachers could not be achieved quickly and was also very expensive. Many families
resented the reforms since it meant a loss of earnings for them. "
2016,Section A,General History,"(a) According to Source A, what problems were caused by Cyclone Bhola in 1970?",3,"It destroyed villages and crops. Nearly 1 million people died. 85% of the area was destroyed.
3 months later 75% of population were receiving food from aid workers. There were ill
feelings towards West Pakistan over the amount of aid "
2016,Section A,General History,(b) What does Source B tell us about the outcome of the conflict between East Pakistan and West Pakistan?,5,"It suggests that the ending of the conflict was an important event because there
are military men of high rank witnessing the signing of a peace treaty. The
source shows that the Indian army had become involved in the conflict. The end
of the conflict led to the formation of Bangladesh. The source suggests that this
news was important so would be broadcast around the subcontinent and
probably the world."
2016,Section A,Objective Resolution 1949,(c) Why did the victory of the Awami League in the 1970 elections in Pakistan cause a constitutional crisis?,7,"President Yahya Khan was not willing to allow the Awami League to take over
the National Assembly by forming a government. The Awami League had won a
landslide victory in East Pakistan and the National Assembly and was in a
position to form a government on its own. The future Prime Minister and the
entire cabinet could be formed from the Awami League. Even though Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto and the Pakistan People’s Party had won an overwhelming victory in
West Pakistan, it was likely it would have no role in the future government. The Awami League had won the election on a programme limiting the power of
central government over the provinces. The different areas of the country
wanted to have control over their foreign exchange earned from trade which
would subsequently reduce the funds to the central government in West
Pakistan."
2016,Section A,Fall of Dhaka 1971,(d) How successful have relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh been from 1971 to 1999? Explain your answer.,10,"In 1974 the Prime Minister Sheikh Mujib was invited to meeting of the
Organisation of Islamic Countries in Lahore. Pakistan agreed to officially
recognise Bangladesh. The countries agreed to view each other as Muslim
friends and to resolve their differences. In 1975/6 there was an exchange of
ambassadors and an agreement was reached to cooperate on trade, tourism
and the media. In 1986 trade between the two countries reached a value of $40
million. In 1985 and 1988 Pakistan was the first country to provide aid to
Bangladesh due to severe weather. Pakistan withdrew from Commonwealth and SEATO. Some non-Bengalis
reported facing persecution and deprivation in Bangladesh. In 1974 Zulfiqar Ali
Bhutto visited Bangladesh to discuss the redistribution of shared assets but
nothing was agreed. There was disagreement over the role of non-Bengalis in
Bangladesh."
2016,Section B,War of Independence 1857,2 (a) What happened at Cawnpore in 1857?,4,"Indian troops, led by Nana Sahib, rose up against the British, trapping their forces who
surrendered after 3 weeks. As they left, the British soldiers and 300 women and children
were killed the remainder were kept as prisoners and later killed. Later the British carried out
acts of revenge. Nana Sahib escaped. "
2016,Section B,Kashmir Dispute,(b) Explain the appeal of India to the East India Company during the early seventeenth century.,7,"Indian troops, led by Nana Sahib, rose up against the British, trapping their forces who
surrendered after 3 weeks. As they left, the British soldiers and 300 women and children
were killed the remainder were kept as prisoners and later killed. Later the British carried out
acts of revenge. Nana Sahib escaped. "
2016,Section B,General History,(c) Did Shah Waliullah contribute more to the spread of Islam than anyone else in the sub- continent before 1850? Explain your answer.,14,"Shah Waliullah: He felt that the Muslims faced many problems because of their level of knowledge about Islam and the Holy Quran. He encouraged them to concentrate on Quranic teachings and helped them by translating the Holy Quran into Persian which was the main language of the Muslims at that time.
His books were designed to spread the principles of Islam amongst Muslims.
Syed Ahmad: 
Spread Islam through the Jihad Movement, which was to become an armed
struggle to liberate the Punjab and the North West Frontier. It grew largely
because Muslims were banned from prayer and found it difficult to practise their
religion.
Haji Shariatullah: 
Spread Islam through the Faraizi Movement which encouraged Muslims to
perform their faraiz (religious obligations). This restored the pride in the
community. A huge group of followers grew called ‘Faraizis’.  "
2016,Section B,Kashmir Dispute,3 (a) What were the terms of the Indian Councils Act of 1909?,4,"Also known as the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909. The Imperial Council increased to 60
members by adding more non-official members. The British retained control. The Central
Executive Council increased by 60 members and could discuss matters of importance and
advise on government policies including the budget. Provincial Councils also increased to 50
members in larger provinces and 30 members in smaller provinces. Muslim representatives
to the Councils to be elected by a separate Muslim-only electorate."
2016,Section B,Partition of Bengal,(b) Explain why the British partitioned Bengal in 1905.,7,"Of the 54 million people in Bengal, 42 million were Hindus. It seemed sensible
to divide up the province on religious grounds. It was a very large province that
created significant administrative difficulties. The British felt that partition of the
province would make it easier to administer, especially at the time of a new
British government in power. The Hindu community saw it as a policy of ‘Divide
and Rule’, an attempt by the British to work against them. "
2016,Section B,Kashmir Dispute,(c) Was the introduction of the Rowlatt Act in 1919 the sole cause of violence in India during 1919 and 1920? Explain your answer.,14,"The Rowlatt Act:
This caused uproar in India because it appeared to go against the central
principles of British justice: trial by jury and safeguards against illegal
imprisonment. The measures were seen as being repressive, especially as
people could be made to live in a particular place and were stopped from
attending meetings. Strikes and demonstrations took place and the British made matters worse by introducing further measures such as banning anti-British
publications.
The Amritsar massacre:
This occurred in 1919 when a large group of Indians were shot dead and
injured, including women and children, for holding an illegal meeting. Although
General Dyer was reprimanded for ordering the shooting, his standing in the
British media was enhanced which offended Indians and resulted in further
violence.
The Government of India Act:
This implemented the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms in 1919, retaining most of
the power in India with central government, at a time when Indians following
their efforts in the First World War had been expecting greater delegation of
power. These measures were opposed, in some cases violently, and a deep
mistrust of the British government grew. Fundamentalist groups grew during the
early 1920s increasing communal violence between Hindus and Muslims"
2016,Section B,General History,4 (a) What was the ‘One Unit’ Scheme?,4,"Iskander Mirza (Acting Governor-General) introduced it in 1955 to unify all of West Pakistan.
He claimed it would bring about greater efficiency and enable more rapid development. West
Pakistan politicians and administrators feared their influence may be challengedif they did
not do this, especially as there were 10 million more people in East Pakistan. By unifying
West Pakistan and making West Pakistan and East Pakistan official with equal
representation in the Assembly, the One Unit Scheme prevented East Pakistan from gaining
a majority in the Assembly. This was very unpopular in East Pakistan."
2016,Section B,General History,(b) Explain why Ayub Khan introduced Martial Law in 1958.,7,"There were a number of Prime Ministers between 1956 and 1958 and it
reached a stage when General Ayub Khan felt the army should take control to
restore stability. East Pakistan’s politicians wanted more say in the running of
the central government which increased tension. Iskander Mirza had lost the
support of many of the leading politicians and was alarmed at a plan by
Suharwardy to unite the political leadership of Bengal and Punjab against him.
Therefore he turned to Ayub Khan and the military for help."
2016,Section B,Independence and Partition,(c) How successful was Pakistan in solving the problems of Partition during 1947 and 1948? Explain your answer.,14,"The Quaid-e-Azam Relief Fund was created to help refugees. Quaid-e-Azam
toured the provinces encouraging and motivating the people. He appealed to
the people to help the refugees. He declared himself ‘Protector-General’ of religious minorities. The State Bank of Pakistan was set up. Karachi was made
capital of Pakistan. The Civil Services were re-organised. Pakistan joined the
United Nations and attempted to draw their attention to Kashmir issue. The Kashmir and other Princely States issues were not resolved. The Canal
Water Dispute was not resolved until 1959. Millions were made homeless or
died as a result of partition. "
2016,Section B,Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto,5 (a) Describe Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s health reforms of 1972.,4,"Zulfikar Ali Bhutto introduced a health scheme in 1972 in which Rural Health Centres and
Basic Health Units in urban areas were to provide widespread healthcare. It expected to set
up 1 Rural Health Centre for every 60000 people and 1 Basic Health Unit for every 20000
people. Training colleges for doctors and nurses were expected to admit students on merit
and on qualification (after first year) they could be placed anywhere by the government. The
sale of branded medicines was banned in an attempt to reduce the cost of these and could
be purchased without prescription. However, the reforms were expensive and there was a
shortage of doctors and nurses. International drug companies closed down their operations
in Pakistan due to a lack of profits from unbranded medicines"
2016,Section B,Zia-ul-Haq and Islamization,(b) Why did Zia-ul-Haq find it difficult to rule Pakistan during the late 1980s?,7,"Zia-ul-Haq found difficulty in managing the breakdown of law and order.
Violence grew throughout the country with killings commonplace in cities such
as Karachi. Drug trafficking grew and there was an increase in levels of
corruption in society. The provinces became more difficult to administer. Sindh
had regular outbreaks of violence and there was a movement to break away
from Pakistan. The NWFP was also becoming more critical of the government.
The explosion at the arms dump at Camp Ojhri in 1988 led to Prime Minister
Junejo setting up an inquiry. Zia-ul-Haq could not tolerate this, so dismissed him
and dissolved the National Assembly. This led to a political crisis for Zia-ul-Haq."
2016,Section B,General History,(c) Was the Co-operative Societies scandal the most important reason why Nawaz Sharif fell from office in 1993? Explain your answer.,14,"Cooperative Societies scandal:
Mismanagement of the Societies led to loss of savings by millions of people.
Many of the Societies had granted huge loans to the Ittefaq Group this
damaged Nawaz Sharif’s reputation.
Kalashnikov culture:
There was easy availability of guns. There was crime, terrorism, kidnappings
and murder. There were issues associated with refugees from the SovietAfghan war. Drug addiction increased.
Economic measures:
Nawaz Sharif increased investment to provide jobs but few loans were repaid.
US aid ceased at the end of the Soviet-Afghan war.
BCCI scandal:
The collapse of BCCI bank in 1991 due to concerns about the bank’s lending
practices. Investors lost huge sums of money.
Shariat Bill:
There was some opposition to the increased role of religion in government.
Relations with President:
Nawaz Sharif disagreed with the President over the appointment of a new army
chief of staff and Eighth Amendment. "
2017,Section A,Kashmir Dispute,"(a) According to Source A, what difficulties did the Indian cotton industry face during the nineteenth century?",3,"Indian production of cotton goods was discouraged – in favour of British
industry.
Only allowed to grow raw cotton to supply British looms.
Skilled workers had to work in East India Company (EIC) factories.
EIC controlled Indian weaving production. Very high tariffs prevented Indian silk and cotton from entering Britain.
No duty on British goods reaching India. "
2017,Section A,Kashmir Dispute,(b) How does Source B help us to understand Indian concerns about the building of railways in India during the nineteenth century?,5,"It looks dangerous / unsafe to travel by rail due to the risk of derailment or
accident, which might cause injury and death.
Since railways were not built safely at first, accidents like these were
frequent in India.
Accidents like the one shown in the source made some people fear that
railways were dangerous. Some people also worried that the British were trying to change their way
of life."
2017,Section A,Kashmir Dispute,(c) Why did the British build railways in India during the nineteenth century?,7,"Railways transported raw materials easily/cheaply to the ports for export/
manufactured goods to be sold throughout India, increasing British profits.
Railways carried troops swiftly around India (helping the British to
maintain law and order and extend power).
 British could travel the country and spread their ideas / culture, gaining
support / to govern effectively.
In times of famine food could be transported quickly to affected areas.
To win support of Indians who found them useful for travel as families
were able to travel to visit relatives in other parts of India. "
2017,Section A,War of Independence 1857,(d) Was an absence of leadership the main reason why the War of Independence in 1857 failed? Explain your answer.,10,"No single leader e.g. Bhadur Shah was not accepted by most Hindus.
Many people at the time thought Bhadur Shah did not have strong
leadership skills and that he was more of a figurehead.
Bahadur Shah and the Rani of Jhansi worked alone, and neither would
support the other.
Lack of unity and common cause amongst the Indian population.
The Punjab was uninterested in helping the rebellion, sending men and
supplies to help the British.
Some of the Indian princes were more interested in restoring their own
powers and this often depended upon the support of the British. Muslims were more likely to oppose the British in the war but there was
not a sense of unity with Sikhs and Hindus who were less likely to support
them in their cause.
A series of uprisings against the British, the Indians were not as
coordinated or strong so the British overcame them.
The British had modern methods of fighting.
The British army was well disciplined and supplied by some of the local
rulers.
The British used diplomatic as well as military mechanisms to limit the
extent of the conflict. "
2017,Section B,General History,2 (a) Who were zamindars?,4,"Landlords/tax collectors.
Wealthy and influential, some had private armies.
After death of Aurangzeb they were increasingly unwilling to accept rule of
any new emperor or to make payments to government in Delhi.
Beard tax imposed which annoyed Muslims.
Muslims were oppressed by zamindars from the 1800’s onwards,
especially in East Bengal. "
2017,Section B,General History,(b) Why was Robert Clive appointed the first Governor of Bengal?,7,"Clive commanded the British army to victory at the battle of Plassey in
1757 and established relations with Mir Jafar.
The battle increased Clive’s reputation and his importance to the East
India Company (EIC) because he became the foremost commander of
British forces in India.
The battle was also a success for the EIC because they now controlled
the profitable trade in Bengal.
As a reward for being considered responsible for the EIC amassing
immense fortunes, especially in Bengal
Clive’s reputation and importance was further enhanced by his success at
the battle of Buxar in 1764 which increased British control of eastern
India. "
2017,Section B,Mughal Empire,(c) Was the in-fighting between Aurangzeb’s successors the most important reason for the break‑up of the Mughal Empire? Explain your answer.,14,"The absence of a definite line of succession led to in-fighting, instability
and the downfall of the Mughal Empire.
Led to inefficiencies and a lack of interest in the running of the Mughal
Empire. As the Mughal Empire started to decline it became at risk from invasion.
After Aurangzeb’s death, Mughal emperors were renowned for living an
extravagant lifestyle and spending money without considering the effect
on the economy of the Empire.
The Afghans under the leadership of Ahmad Shah Abdali defeated the
Marathas at Paniplat. The Afghans had been in control of much of the
Empire for some time but were unable to make the most of their victory
and returned to Kabul. However they did invade the Empire a number of
times during the 18th Century.
The Persians under Nadir Shah captured much of the Empire’s wealth
and returned home with gold, jewels and the Peacock throne from Delhi.
Aurangzeb often showed intolerance to non-Muslims. He introduced a tax
on non-Muslims called the Jizya. During Aurangzeb’s reign, some Hindu
temples were destroyed and some limits were placed on Hindu practices.
Taxation was high as because of the costs of military campaigns such as
the Deccan Wars and building luxurious palaces. Because of these he
became an unpopular ruler.
Maratha guerrilla fighters defeated a Mughal army in 1737 and took
control of Delhi and eastwards towards Bengal. By 1760 they were the
most powerful group in India and the Mughals were unable to limit their
expansion.
The British expansion into the subcontinent was rapid, overwhelming the
Mughal forces and equipment."
2017,Section B,General History,3 (a) How did the name ‘Pakistan’ originate?,4,"Chaudhry Rehmat Ali devised the name.
Stated in pamphlet ‘Now or Never’ in 1933.
By end of the year most Muslims within India knew the name and its
importance.
Punjab, Afghania (NWFP), Kashmir, Sindh and Balochistan.
Muslim League thought his ideas were impractical and ignored by Jinnah."
2017,Section B,General History,(b) Why was the Second Round Table Conference of 1931 unsuccessful?,7,"Gandhi did not accept that the 14 Points of the Quaid-e-Azam should be
included in future discussions.
Gandhi did not accept the demands about the rights of minorities.
The Conference was unsuccessful because Gandhi refused to recognise
the rights of the Muslim."
2017,Section B,Mughal Empire,(c) Was the withdrawal of Gandhi’s support the most important reason for the decline of the Khilafat Movement? Explain your answer.,14,"Gandhi saw an opportunity for self-rule by joining the Movement, the
involvement of a Hindu-majority grouping was welcomed by many
Muslims.
By joining with a Hindu-majority grouping the objectives of the Movement
were made less clear. Some perceived that Gandhi and some Hindus and
used it for their own political reasons.
Chauri Chaura was a village in the United Province where trouble started
between the police and a mob. Gandhi decided that the Swaraj Movement
was becoming too violent following the Chauri Chaura incident and so
withdrew his support.
Other reasons
Thousands of Muslims migrated to Afghanistan in a religious protest
against the British government. The Afghan government was hostile to the
migrants and refused to allow all the refugees to settle.
Many of the refugees who returned to India died on the journey back or
found themselves homeless and their jobs occupied which dispirited them.
Some of the leaders including Maulana and Muhammad Ali were
imprisoned in 1921 which made the organisation less effective.
The refusal of Britain to accept the demands of the Movement.
The decision of the Mustafa Kamal Ataturk to form a nationalist
government in Turkey ended most of the impetus for the Khalifat
movement, which had previously served as a unifying force for Muslims.
Mopla violence divided Muslims. "
2017,Section B,General History,4 (a) What were the Basic Democracies?,4,"In 1959 local committees were named Basic Democrats (BD).
80 000 BD’s.
No political parties to take place in the elections held December 1959 to
January 1960.
Newly elected BD’s able to vote in referendum on Ayub Khan remaining
President, 95% voted yes. "
2017,Section B,Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto,(b) Explain why Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s rule ended in 1977.,7,"The focal point of political power lay with the party leadership and with
Bhutto in particular, so when things went wrong he was blamed.
The changes in education were criticised as they led to overcrowding in
existing schools whilst new ones were built/the building of new schools/
the recruitment of new teachers could not be achieved quickly/was very
expensive.
Many families resented the educational reforms because it meant a loss
of earnings for them.
Opponents alleged that Bhutto and his party manipulated the election in
March 1977, which led to protests that were put down by the police.
Martial law was imposed in Karachi, Lahore and Hyderabad and strikes by
bus and truck drivers in Karachi (Operation Wheel Jam), caused further
problems for Bhutto.
During Bhutto’s time in office the economy declined which contributed to
unrest and reduced support for his government."
2017,Section B,General History,(c) Which of the following contributed the most to Pakistan’s domestic policies between 1948 and 1958?,14,"Khwaja Nazimuddin:
1948 made 2nd Governor General, appointed Liaquat Ali Khan Prime
Minister.
Made Objectives Resolution in 1949. It focussed on the principles of Islam
and human rights. Designed to deflect criticism from religious leaders who
wanted the new state to be more Islamic.
Drafted a constitution, which attracted much criticism as it was seen by
many as being insufficiently Islamic.
Kept the economy going and produced surplus budgets for the new state.
Malik Ghulam Muhammad:
As 3rd Governor General responsible for the Six Year Plan for agriculture,
power, industry and transport. It was important to the economic
development of Pakistan.
Severe problems hampered development such as food shortages and
drought. Rioting followed and the government found it challenging to
overcome these issues, leading to many personnel changes. Little
constitutional development could take place because of these challenges.
He resigned in 1955 due to ill health.
Iskander Mirza:
Became acting Governor General in 1955.
Introduced the One Unit policy in 1955, which he claimed would bring
about greater efficiency and development in West Pakistan. The policy
meant that East Pakistan could not gain a majority in the Assembly.
Introduced the new Constitution in 1956, under which he was able to
become President.
He suspended the Constitution in 1958 and declared Martial Law.
His rule became unpopular and lost the support of many leading politicians.
He declared Martial Law but was forced to resign by Ayub Khan in 1958"
2017,Section B,General History,(a) What was SEATO?,4,"1955 South East Asia Treaty Organisation.
Also included USA and Britain.
Sometimes called Manila Pact in Pakistan.
Joined in 1955. Withdrew in 1972.
Aimed to resist Communist expansion.
Pakistan surprised other Muslim countries by being so closely allied with
USA. "
2017,Section B,General History,(b) Why did being a nuclear power create difficulties for Pakistan in the 1980s and 1990s?,7,"US diplomats expressed concern that Pakistan may have nuclear
weapons, and would not give aid to Pakistan, stating Pakistan was in
contravention of the 1985 Pressler Amendment. The USA had promised
$4 million in an economic package to help Pakistan to refurbish their
military forces.
The reduction in aid seriously affected Pakistan. In particular, the delivery
of 28 F-16 fighter jets in which weakened Pakistan’s relationship with
USA.
The Pakistan government expressed concerns about the status of India
as a nuclear power. "
2017,Section B,Independence and Partition,(c) To what extent was the relationship between Pakistan and its neighbour Afghanistan successful from 1947 to 1999?,14,"During Zahir Shah’s time in office relations between Afghanistan and
Pakistan were friendly and during the 1965 War remained neutral despite
pressure from other powers.
There were good relations when an Islamic foreign policy was introduced,
leading to visits between both countries by Bhutto and later Zia-ul-Haq
and Daud in 1970’s.
There was humane treatment in Pakistan of Afghan refugees following
outbreak of Afghan–Russian War. Afghanistan had territorial claims to part of the North West Frontier
Province (NWFP) following establishment of Pakistan in 1947.
Afghanistan voted against Pakistan joining UN in 1947.
Afghanistan did not always adhere to a trade agreement with Pakistan; Diplomatic relations between the two countries were withdrawn in 1955
but later renewed.
During the Afghan–Russian War, planes entered Pakistani airspace and
some of the Pakistani frontier areas were bombed.
After the war, law and order was hard to restore in Afghanistan; problems
spread into the border region relating to drugs, armed robberies,
kidnappings and gun battles between rival gangs.
There was an increase in Islamic militancy following support given to the
Taliban in Afghanistan."
2018,Section A,Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto,"(a) According to Source A, what were the effects of the High Court judgement regarding Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto on the people of Pakistan?",3,"People were stunned.
There were arrests.
Some people died in clashes.
There was strong opposition.
There were strikes.
There were peaceful protests.
There were demonstrations."
2018,Section A,Zia-ul-Haq and Islamization,(b) How does Source B help us to understand the way Zia-ul-Haq governed Pakistan?,5,"Zia-ul-Haq is firmly in charge of Pakistan. This can be seen by him
wearing a military uniform.
He is a figure of power / authority / determination / vision / decisiveness /
commitment. This can be seen by him raising his arm / pointing his finger.
He wants to display his power. This can be seen by the decorative
surroundings which emphasise the power and majesty of the office of the
President.
He wants his message to be heard / he believes what he is saying is very
important / communication is very important. This can be seen by the
many microphones in front of him.
He used martial law to demonstrate control, which was enhanced by the
passing of the Eighth Amendment in 1985."
2018,Section A,Zia-ul-Haq and Islamization,(c) Why did Zia-ul-Haq introduce his Islamisation reforms?,7,"To produce a strong and stable government managed by people
committed to Islamic values.
He wanted to provide a counter to Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto’s socialist
government which he saw as liberal / westernised.
He made the Islamic laws strict in order to produce a strong government
by imposing a strict legal code.
He wanted to implement laws which punished people for showing
disrespect towards the Prophet and ensured that Islamic education was
implemented in schools to raise Islamic awareness.
He wanted to distribute some wealth to the poor and needy by introducing
Islamic taxes following Islamic principles. "
2018,Section A,Zia-ul-Haq and Islamization,(d) How successful was Zia-ul-Haq’s foreign policy between 1978 and 1988? Explain your answer.,10,"Pakistan’s relationship with China was strengthened in 1978 with the
opening of the Karakoram Highway between the two countries, opening
up huge areas of both countries to trade and tourism.
Pakistan received support from the West to assist Afghan fighters in their
conflict with Russia in 1979. The USA gave Pakistan $3.2 billion over six
years to help cope with the influx of refugees from Afghanistan (the
Afghan Miracle).
Negotiations between Pakistan and Bangladesh on tourism, culture and
trade, brought an extra $40 billion a year into Pakistan by 1986. Pakistan became a target of Russia as a result of supplying Afghans with
arms. Border villages were bombed and a series of explosions happened
across the country.
Threats to law and order as a consequence of the Afghan Miracle."
2018,Section B,General History,2 (a) Who was Titu Mir?,4,"Syed Mir Nisar was a Bengali.
He reinforced traditional Muslim values.
He was determined to free Bengal from British rule.
He organised a stand against zamindars.
He set up his own rule near Calcutta with a small army.
He built a bamboo fort at Narkelbaria in 1831 and defeated the British
troops sent to destroy it.
He was killed in battle in 1831. "
2018,Section B,Sir Syed Ahmed Khan & Aligarh Movement,(b) Explain why Sir Syed Ahmad Khan tried to improve relations between the Muslim community and the British.,7,"Sir Syed Ahmad Khan wanted to improve their social and economic
conditions by taking up posts in the civil service and the army. In order to
do this, the Muslim community needed to embrace the British-styled
education system, which would open the door to these roles.
If the Muslim community did not do these things and foster good relations
with the British, then they may see the Hindu community prosper at their
expense.
He wrote The Loyal Mohammadens of India to prove to the British that
the Muslim community could be trusted after the War of Independence."
2018,Section B,War of Independence 1857,(c) Was religion the most important reason for the War of Independence in 1857? Give reasons for your answer.,14,"Christian missionaries came to India to convert the local population and
set up schools. In these schools, the missionaries taught Christianity and
expected local religions to be given up which was resented by the
Muslim, Hindu and Sikh communities.
The British introduced a new gun that used cartridges coated in grease
made from cow and pig fat. The soldiers had to rip open the cartridges
with their teeth before loading. This caused great resentment as it was
contrary to religious beliefs for both Muslim and Hindu communities and
united them against the British. The replacement of Persian and Sanskrit by English as the official
language in the 1830s deeply upset both the Muslims and Hindus as they
felt that their culture was being threatened.
The British imposed reforms on the Indian population such as
abandoning purdah / suttee without consultation. This caused much
unrest as it appeared that the British were trying to impose their culture
on centuries of Indian customs, which was resented. (Purdah / suttee
may also be seen as religious reasons.)
In 1852 the ‘Doctrine of Lapse’ was introduced and caused great unrest
because any local kingdom not having a direct male heir had their lands
taken over by the British. "
2018,Section B,General History,3 (a) What was the Swadeshi Movement?,4,"A boycott of British goods by Hindus during / because of the Partition of
Bengal, 1905–11.
British cloth was thrown onto bonfires.
The Hindu community wore locally produced clothes.
There were a series of strikes by Indian workers, e.g. in Calcutta."
2018,Section B,Sir Syed Ahmed Khan & Aligarh Movement,(b) Explain why the Muslim community felt it necessary to form their own political party in 1906.,7,"They felt that Muslim rights would not be advanced if they continued to
rely on the Indian National Congress (Congress) which was seen as an
organisation that promoted views of the Hindu community.
Congress was demanding that India should be treated as a cultural whole
and Hindi should be declared the official language.
Congress opposed the Partition of Bengal and the Muslim community
realised that Hindus would achieve its reversal, so wanted their own
political party to safeguard their interests as Congress was not doing this.
The growth of Hindu nationalist groups demanding that Muslims be
forcibly converted to Hinduism.
The Simla Agreement showed that Muslims were a separate community
and needed their own political party."
2018,Section B,General History,(c) Was the First Round Table Conference of 1930 more successful than the two that followed in 1931 and 1932? Explain your answer.,14,"Federal system for India approved as the Princes declared they would
join a future federation as long as their rights were recognised. Congress attended which was a step forward, although this had been
made possible only through talks between Gandhi and the Viceroy Lord
Irwin. Congress boycotted the talks and without them representing the majority
of Indians, progress could not be made. Gandhi was seen as being stubborn, taking a hard line in the talks, and
refusing to recognise the problems of the minorities. He advanced the
argument that he spoke for all Indians with which Jinnah disagreed. Congress was absent again as Gandhi and Nehru had been imprisoned
due to the renewal of the non-cooperation movement, so Congress
boycotted the talks. There were three Round Table Conferences (RTC) held in London.
Both Gandhi and Jinnah attended some of the RTC’s but not necessarily
at the same time.
Congress did not attend the first RTC and began non-cooperation
programme.
The Muslim community felt the first RTC was a success.
At the first RTC the Princely States declared they would join a future
federal system for India.
The British agreed at the first RTC that representative government should
be introduced at provincial level.
Congress attended the second RTC.
Agreement that the NWFP and Sindh should be made provinces was
made at the second RTC.
Gandhi was seen as refusing to recognise the problems of the minorities.
Congress boycotted the third RTC.
The Princes also boycotted the third RTC.
Jinnah went into voluntary exile.
Nothing of importance was agreed at the third RTC."
2018,Section B,Independence and Partition,4 (a) What was the Radcliffe Award?,4,"Sir Cyril Radcliffe chaired the Radcliffe Award and gave his name to it.
It established the new borders of India and Pakistan in 1947, particularly
in Bengal and the Punjab.
He had four assistants, two nominated by the Muslim League and two by
Congress.
The results were announced on 16 August 1947. "
2018,Section B,General History,(b) Explain why Pakistan has given continued support to the Palestinian cause.,7,"Pakistan is a member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)
which aims to promote harmony and co-operation between Muslim
nations and supports the agreement that the Palestinian issue is a matter
for all Islamic countries. Thus Pakistan supported the Palestinian cause.
The incident of the Al-Aqsa Mosque was discussed at the first meeting of
the OIC and support was immediately offered to the Palestinians. At the
summit in Lahore in 1974, more specific support was given. "
2018,Section B,Khilafat & Non-Cooperation Movement,(c) Were the Gandhi–Jinnah talks the most important factor during the 1940s that led to the partition of the subcontinent in 1947? Give reasons for your answer.,14,"It was an important meeting as Gandhi had been forced to negotiate with
the Muslim League on an equal footing for the first time regarding the
future of India.
Gandhi wanted to achieve independence first – partition discussions
could follow later – whereas Jinnah wanted to settle the issue of partition
first and before the British left. He knew that his bargaining position would
be much weaker if he went along with Gandhi’s plan. The Lahore Resolution, 1940 drafted by the 25-man All-India Muslim
League asked for greater Muslim autonomy within India; this was seen as
a demand for a separate Muslim state. From then on, the aims of the
Muslim League were clear: an independent nation state.
The results of the 1945–46 elections demonstrated that Congress had
control of the non-Muslim votes but that the League had gained control of
the Muslim vote. The Muslim League was now an equal player to
Congress so the demand for Partition could no longer be ignored by
Congress or the British government.
In March 1946, members of the British Cabinet Mission arrived in India to
work out a plan for achieving independence for India as a federation
which the Muslim League accepted but Congress refused to accept the
province groupings and stated that they would not be bound by any
British plan. The British government decided to form an interim
government headed by Nehru joined by members of the Muslim League.
As the Muslim League were concerned that the British would leave India
without organising a settlement and that Congress would be left to
organise a new country, they organised a Direct Action Day in the
summer of 1946 with the aim of stopping the British government giving in
to Congress. The disruption worried the British, so gradually they shifted
their position on Partition."
2018,Section B,General History,5 (a) What was CENTO?,4,"Originally the Baghdad Pact formed in 1955 with Turkey and Iraq. Later
that year Pakistan, Iran and Britain joined to establish an anti-Communist
alliance against the Soviet Union.
All except Britain were Muslim countries.
Pact renamed CENTO (Central Treaty Organisation) after Iraq left in
1959.
Never developed a permanent structure or system for raising troops for
mutual defence and was dissolved in 1979.
USA supported the organisation but did not become a member."
2018,Section B,Objective Resolution 1949,(b) Explain why there was a constitutional crisis in 1958.,7,"There were a number of Prime Ministers between 1956 and 1958 and it
reached a stage where Ayub Khan felt the army should take control until
stability had been restored.
Previous governments endured a number of problems that hampered
development such as food shortages and a drought, which led to
demonstrations of discontent. As successive governments found difficulty
in dealing with these matters, there were many personnel changes to try
to find a solution. As a result, little constitutional development could take
place.
Iskander Mirza lost the support of many of the leading politicians and was
alarmed at a plan by Prime Minister Suhrawardy to unite the political
leadership of Bengal and Punjab against him. There were many Prime Ministers between 1956 and 1958 / the
government was unstable.
Drought and food shortages presented a challenge to development.
Iskander Mirza lost support. "
2018,Section B,Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto,(c) Were the challenges facing Benazir Bhutto in Sindh the main reason why she left office in 1990? Explain your answer.,14,"Well educated muhajirs opposed the special rights for Sindhis introduced
by Benazir Bhutto and increasingly supported the Muhajir Quami
Movement (MQM).
Sindh was an area of growing opposition to the Pakistan People’s Party
(PPP) and growing support for the MQM.
Benazir Bhutto tried in vain to gain the support of the MQM to form a
coalition government by promising to protect the interests of all the
people of Sindh. Her government was damaged by an unsuccessful no-confidence motion
tabled by opposition parties including Islami Jamhuri Ittehad (IJI) led by
Nawaz Sharif.
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan refused to appoint the judges and military
personnel she wished, making it difficult for her to govern Pakistan
effectively.
Promised economic development programmes and social and health
reforms did not produce the effects hoped for. The government lost
support as unemployment, inflation and population grew rapidly making
progress difficult.
Accusations from political opponents regarding mismanagement leading
to the arrest and jailing of her husband Asif Ali Zardari. Further rumours
weakened the government enabling President Ghulam Ishaq Khan to use
the Eighth Amendment to dismiss the government in 1990."
2019,Section A,General History,"(a) According to Source A, why did many people die at Fort William in 1756?",3,"Several were already wounded.
Conditions in the cell were dirty, would have infected soldiers’
wounds.
Lack of fresh air / suffocation.
Lack of water / dehydration.
Trampled to death trying to reach water / fresh air.
Crushed to death in overcrowded cell.
Guards showed no interest in prisoners’ welfare."
2019,Section A,General History,(b) What can we learn from Source B about famine in the subcontinent during British control?,5,"Food was being given to a man who looks very weak suggesting that
the famine has been going on for a long time.
The problem of hunger was widespread because many people of
different ages, men, women and children, were affected and were
waiting for relief.
Famine must have been a serious problem because relief has been
organised.
People are looking underfed / malnourished and are waiting for the
distribution of food which is being given out to these people in the
source.
The man in the bowler hat is an official observing / involved in or
supervising the process, which shows that the British were involved with
the distribution of relief. "
2019,Section A,Mughal Empire,(c) Explain why Robert Clive was successful in the Battle of Plassey in 1757.,7,"Clive persuaded one of the Nawab’s key men, Mir Jafar, to side with the
British. Jafar’s defection weakened the Nawab’s army, which Clive was
able to use to his advantage.
Clive ordered his men to cover their cannon when it rained. So, the dry
cannons of Clive’s army outfired the Nawab’s cannons.
Clive was an experienced soldier as he had fought the French in
southern India. He was used to the tactics of warfare, this helped to
defeat the Nawab. "
2019,Section A,Kashmir Dispute,(d) Was the India Act of 1784 the main reason why the British were able to expand beyond Bengal between 1784 and 1850? Explain your answer.,10,"This made the position of Governor General a royal appointment. Lord
Cornwallis was appointed to this position in 1786.
A Board of Control replaced the East India Company’s Board of
Directors, changing it from a trading concern to a sovereign body in
which the Crown had direct control of Bengal.
A police system was developed to help in the administering of justice
and maintaining law and order. Lord Cornwallis introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793 making
zamindars of Bengal landowners, subject to their payment of a fixed
sum to the British. In 1793 this amounted to some 10% of the total sum
collected by the zamindars. The Permanent Settlement secured the
financial interest of the East India Company and helped Bengal to
become the wealthiest province in India, allowing the British to extend
their control.
Local rulers were persuaded to sign subsidiary alliances by Lord
Wellesley who became Governor General in 1798. The local ruler
continued to run their affairs while British soldiers offered protection. In
return for this protection the ruler paid towards the cost of the soldiers
and accepted a British resident adviser. This consolidated Britain’s
power in India at little cost and extended British control.
The annexation of land. Hyderabad and Oudh accepted British
protection with a subsidiary alliance. Mysore, Oudh, Delhi and the
Marathas came under British control by the early nineteenth century,
followed shortly afterwards by Sindh and the Punjab. "
2019,Section B,General History,2 (a) Who was Ahmad Shah Durrani?,4,"Known also as Ahmad Shah Abdali, an Afghan leader, a military genius
who had excellent tactical skills.
He beat the Marathas at the battle of Panipat in 1761, which ended the
ambitions of the Marathas.
Durrani was unable to make the most of his victory; as his followers
mutinied he gave up his idea of an Indian empire and returned to
Kabul. "
2019,Section B,Kashmir Dispute,(b) Explain why the British wanted to trade in India from 1600.,7,"Reports of immense wealth in the subcontinent led to the British
establishing a trading base there as they saw a profitable future.
The British wanted to establish their influence in the subcontinent and
to oust the Dutch and Portuguese.
The British also wanted to establish a strategic port in the subcontinent
that would protect its trading interests there and in the Far East. "
2019,Section B,General History,(c) Did Syed Ahmad Barelvi contribute more to the spread of Islam than anyone else in the subcontinent before 1840? Explain your answer.,14,"Syed Ahmad Barelvi spread Islam through the Jihad Movement, which became an armed
struggle to liberate the Punjab and the NWF from non-Muslim 
oppression and was the first example of a movement to restore Muslim
power.
As at this time the Muslim community were not allowed freedom of
worship, the mujahideen fought campaigns to achieve religious and
spiritual freedoms.
His work was a uniting force for Muslim groups and an inspiration. Haji Shariatullah spread Islam through the Faraizi Movement, which removed Hindu
practices from worship and called on Muslim groups to perform their
proper observation of Islamic duties (faraiz).
Aimed to restore the pride of the Muslim community. A huge group of
followers grew called ‘Faraizis’.
The movement alarmed the Hindu landlords of East Bengal, as the
Faraizis in Bengal united against the treatment they had received. Shah Waliullah believed the Muslims faced problems because of their incomplete
knowledge of Islam and the Holy Quran. To reverse the decline in
Muslim power he taught that there needed to be spiritual and moral
regeneration based upon the principles of Islam.
He encouraged the Muslim community to concentrate on Quranic
teachings and translated the Holy Quran into Persian, which was the
main language of Muslim groups at that time.
He wrote many books, which were designed to spread the principles of
Islam amongst the Muslim community in order to unite them. He aimed
to provide the inspiration for Muslims to lead a pure life."
2019,Section B,General History,3 (a) Who was Lord Wellesley?,4,"Governor General of India in 1798.
Wellesley persuaded local princes / rulers to sign subsidiary alliances.
Local rulers were also forbidden to make any other alliances.
In 1799 Wellesley invaded Mysore killing Tipu Sultan and gaining control
of his lands.
Wellesley also defeated the Nawabs of Oudh and took control of their
territory."
2019,Section B,War of Independence 1857,(b) Why did the War of Independence of 1857 not succeed?,7,"The Indian population were not united in a common cause.
The Punjab was uninterested in helping the rebellion and actually sent
men and supplies to help the British as they did not want imperial power
restored.
This also happened in Kashmir where the ruler sent 2000 troops to help
the British as this benefitted his own feudal powers.
The British had modern methods of fighting and the army was well
organised as well as being supplied by some of the local rulers."
2019,Section B,War of Independence 1857,(c) Were Sir Syed Ahmad Khan’s religious views his most important contribution to the Muslim cause after 1857? Explain your answer.,14,"He believed relations with the British could be improved by improving
the understanding of Christianity by Muslim groups. He tried to
overcome this by writing Tabyin-ul-Kalam, in which he pointed out the
similarities between Islam and Christianity.
He was also aware that the British knew little about Islam. After reading
a book in Britain on the life of the Prophet, he wrote his own work
correcting the many errors he had read. In 1863 he founded the Scientific Society at Ghazipore. He wanted to
make scientific writings available to Muslims by translating them from
English into Urdu.
He established a Muslim college, which led to the Muslim-Anglo Oriental
College in 1876. This became the University of Aligarh, which became
important as it educated many future leaders.
Improving the position of the Muslim community in society through
encouraging a Western education. He recognised that the Muslim community could not win any election
because of the Hindu majority population, so he advocated separate
seats and a separate electorate, which was the forerunner of the future
demand for a separate homeland.
His books following the War of Independence attempted to restore
British understanding about the Muslim community. He showed that
there were Muslim supporters of the British government. He gave
explanation of the word ‘Nadarath’ and suggested that the British should
try to understand Muslim groups better. Sir Syed was concerned that the Hindu community demanded that Hindi
should be made the official language in 1867 in place of Urdu. He
became opposed to the way that Congress was working for the interests
of Hindus in a way that was detrimental to the Muslim community. This
led to the formation of the United Patriotic Alliance.
Sir Syed emphasised this threat to the Muslim community and
developed his Two Nation Theory, as a result many Muslim groups
called him the ‘Father of the Pakistan Movement’."
2019,Section B,General History,4 (a) Who was Rahmat Ali?,4,"In 1930 he left India to study law at Cambridge.
Attended conferences in London on the position of the Hindu and
Muslim communities in India.
Believed in a separate Muslim homeland.
In 1933 he produced a pamphlet, ‘Now or Never’, which argued in
favour of partition.
Became popular amongst most Muslim groups during the 1930s.
Formed the Pakistan National Movement.
Developed the name of Pakistan."
2019,Section B,Sir Syed Ahmed Khan & Aligarh Movement,(b) Explain why the Muslim community objected to the rule of the Congress party between 1937 and 1939.,7,"The erosion of Muslim identity and culture. Muslims were forbidden to
eat beef and received harsh punishments if they slaughtered cows.
Hindi was enforced as the official language and organised attacks were
made on mosques. This made the Muslim community feel that their
language and religion were being made worthless.
Bande Matram, a nationalistic Hindu song, was adopted. It encouraged
Hindus to expel Muslims from ‘Hindustan’. Singing of the song was
made compulsory before the start of business every day in the
provincial assemblies.
Another scheme, the Widdia Mandar scheme, indirectly aimed to
convert all non-Hindus to Hinduism. It was introduced in all schools and
colleges. It promoted Hindu myths and heroes, adopting them as
national icons. Muslim groups felt it was an attempt to subvert their
faith.
The Wardha scheme was a new educational policy that required
students to bow before Gandhi’s picture each day. Spinning cotton by
hand was introduced into the school curriculum. Teaching was in Hindi
with no religious education, which meant that Muslim students were at
a disadvantage and again they felt this was a covert attempt at
conversion by Congress."
2019,Section B,Khilafat & Non-Cooperation Movement,(c) Was the Moplah uprising in 1921 the main reason for the end of the Khilafat Movement? Explain your answer.,14,"Moplahs were deeply religious Muslims who rose up against their
Hindu landlords and the British in South India. Their activities
destroyed a police station and Hindu property. This action divided
Hindus and Muslims and put in doubt Hindu cooperation in the Khilafat
Movement. 18 000 Muslim people migrated to Afghanistan (hijrat) to protect and
foster Islam after a promise of homes and land. However the Afghan
government did not welcome the hijrats and refused many of them
entry. Many of those returning to India died on the journey back or they
found themselves homeless and their jobs occupied. This was
dispiriting for the Muslim community and support for the Khilafat
Movement was lost.
Some of the leaders including Maulana and Muhammad Ali were
imprisoned in 1921, which made the organisation less effective.
Gandhi had seen an opportunity for self-rule by joining the Movement
and the involvement of the Hindu community was initially welcomed by
many Muslims. However, this made the objectives of the Movement
less clear since it was felt that Hindu groups and Gandhi were using it
to advance their own interests, not those of the Muslim community.
The Chauri Chaura incident of violence between protesters and the
police led Gandhi to withdraw his support from the Khilafat Movement.
This left Muslim groups to continue the work of the Movement alone
which, combined with the imprisonment of their leaders and the Hijrat,
was challenging.
The end of the Movement was also brought about by the decision of
the Muslim Mustafa Kamal Ataturk to form a nationalist government in
Turkey. Muslim groups now had no cause to follow."
2019,Section B,General History,5 (a) Describe the Zakat Ordinance.,4,"In 1980, Zia-ul-Haq imposed a 2.5% wealth tax on savings over a
certain amount.
Money raised was given to Zakat committees in villages and towns for
the poor.
Some Muslim groups protested against this since their view of Islamic
law was that giving should be voluntary.
In 1984, these groups held demonstrations in Islamabad forcing Zia-ulHaq to accept their objections and exempt them from paying the tax. "
2019,Section B,General History,(b) Explain why there were many governments between 1951 and 1958.,7,"Jinnah died in 1948 and Liaquat Ali Khan was assassinated in 1951
without these experienced figures it was more difficult to establish a
stable government.
The problems of running a new country were very difficult to overcome,
especially as some of the joint assets were withheld after partition.
Relations with India were strained with no agreement on Kashmir.
Food shortages followed a drought 1951-53. This, combined with an
economic slump, led to rioting which forced changes in the cabinet.
Resistance to the One Unit Policy from East Pakistan contributed to a
loss of support for Iskander Mirza’s government. "
2019,Section B,General History,(c) Were the economic reforms of Ayub Khan the most important of his domestic policies in the ‘Decade of Progress’ between 1958 and 1969? Explain your answer.,14,"The land of smaller farmers was redistributed to farmers with medium
sized farms and agriculture was revitalised to such an extent that crop
outputs were at record levels.
In 1962, an oil refinery was established in Karachi and a Mineral
Development Corporation was set up for the exploration of mineral
deposits which contributed significantly to the economy.
An Export Bonus Scheme was set up offering incentives to
industrialists who increased exports.
The national economic annual growth rate was 7% and the economy
grew three times faster than that of other South Asian countries.
However, the new wealth was concentrated in the hands of a few and
did not bring widespread benefits. The government set about improving housing for refugees. A massive
new housing development provided new homes for refugees in
Karachi, which had a beneficial effect on the lives of these people.
Family Planning Programme used the media to persuade people to
limit family size to slow population growth rates.
In 1959, Basic Democracies were introduced. This was a four tier
structure of government, allowing elections at various levels. The
success of these councils was such that martial law was lifted.
People were prevented from hoarding goods and selling them on at
inflated prices. Profiteers had their goods confiscated and many were
arrested. As a result, this action brought prices of many goods down
and that benefitted people.
The price of milk and other goods were fixed to stop profiteering which
helped families to manage their weekly budget better. "
2020,Section A,General History,(a) According to Source A what were the personal characteristics of Robert Clive?,3,A brave and courageous soldier. A man of initiative. He showed leadership and was determined. He was reckless and unprincipled. He behaved badly. He gambled and took risks in battle. He put his men's lives in danger. He was devious and sly in battle. He was cruel. He was immoral. He was greedy.
2020,Section A,Kashmir Dispute,(b) What can we learn from Source B about the treatment of Indian hostages during the Mysore Wars?,5,"This looks like a ceremony with well-dressed people who are standing in their places, welcoming the hostages. This indicates respect, deference, and care for them. The painting shows Lord Cornwallis shaking or holding the hand of one of the hostages he is greeting. It appears to be a formal and public event of great importance or significance. The painting depicts Lord Cornwallis receiving Tipu Sultan’s sons as hostages to ensure that Tipu Sultan pays according to the terms of the treaty. This painting is intended to portray Cornwallis as gentle, humane, and benevolent by the way he is treating the hostages, so it could be used as propaganda. We do not know if all hostages were treated with such respect, nor whether this scene accurately reflects what actually took place. Presumably, the young princes would have been frightened."
2020,Section A,Kashmir Dispute,(c) Explain why the East India Company was interested in the subcontinent in the years before 1750.,7,"The British wanted to establish their influence in the subcontinent and to remove the presence of the Dutch and Portuguese who were already competing for control. They also aimed to set up a strategic port in the subcontinent to safeguard their trading interests both locally and in the Far East. Furthermore, reports of immense wealth in the subcontinent encouraged the British to establish a trading base there, as they believed it would lead to a profitable future."
2020,Section A,War of Independence 1857,(d) To what extent were economic reforms the main cause of the War of Independence in 1857? Explain your answer.,10,"One important cause of the War of Independence in 1857 was the economic reforms introduced by the British, which created widespread hardship and resentment. The British imposed high taxation in order to extract wealth from India. This burden fell heavily on peasants and small landowners who were unable to pay the taxes, resulting in poverty, starvation, and deep resentment. Many communities who relied on cotton production also suffered due to the British ban on cotton exports in 1800. This policy not only destroyed livelihoods but also increased hostility towards British rule. Additionally, the Sepoys, who were essential to the British military, felt economically oppressed. Their salaries were low, they were rarely promoted, and they were often denied extra pay for service in newly conquered regions like Sindh. This unfair treatment led to growing discontent within the army.

However, economic issues were not the only reason for rebellion. Cultural and religious interference also played a significant role in provoking anger across Indian society. The replacement of Persian and Sanskrit with English as the official language in the 1830s offended both Muslim and Hindu communities as it threatened their traditions and made it harder for many to secure jobs. Religious customs were also ignored; for example, Muslim women were forced to abandon purdah, a move that deeply offended many families. Another major cause of unrest was the introduction of the ‘Doctrine of Lapse’, which allowed the British to annex any kingdom without a direct male heir. This policy threatened the power and autonomy of Indian rulers. Furthermore, the introduction of the new rifle with cartridges greased with cow and pig fat directly insulted both Hindus and Muslims. Sepoys were required to bite the cartridges, which went against their religious beliefs, leading to widespread refusal and anger.

In conclusion, while many factors contributed to the outbreak of the War of Independence, the economic reforms were especially significant because they affected a broad section of the population including soldiers, farmers, and artisans. However, the cultural and religious insensitivity of British policies further united different communities in opposition. Therefore, it was the combination of economic exploitation and religious interference that created the explosive conditions necessary for rebellion."
2020,Section B,General History,2 (a) Who was Mir Qasim?,4,"Mir Qasim became the Nawab of Bengal in 1760, succeeding Mir Jafar.
With the support of the East India Company, he confiscated lands and wealth from the people of Bengal and handed them over to the British.
Eventually, Mir Qasim tried to resist and reduce British influence in Bengal.
In 1764, he fought against the British under Robert Clive at the Battle of Buxar but was defeated."
2020,Section B,General History,(b) Explain why Britain was able to expand into the subcontinent between 1750 and 1850.,7,"The building of railways meant that soldiers could be transported more easily around the country, helping the British to establish control. Trade also benefitted from improved communication across regions.

The battles of Plassey and Buxar gave the British control of Bengal and favourable trading rights with the local nawabs. This allowed the British to access new resources, which they used to strengthen and consolidate their rule.

The British introduced Governor-Generals into the provinces, who administered their regions following British systems. This gave them more direct control and allowed for further expansion of British influence in the subcontinent."
2020,Section B,Mughal Empire,(c) Were the policies of Aurangzeb the main reason for the decline of the Mughal Empire? Explain your answer.,14,"Aurangzeb's Policies
One key reason for the decline of the Mughal Empire was the religious and administrative policies of Aurangzeb. He introduced a tax on non-Muslims called the Jizya, which was seen as discriminatory and unfair. In addition, he ordered the destruction of Hindu temples and attempted to ban Hindu practices. These decisions significantly reduced his popularity among his Hindu subjects and sparked several insurgencies during his reign, weakening internal unity.

Aurangzeb also imposed high taxation to fund costly military campaigns such as the Deccan Wars. These taxes placed a heavy burden on the population and increased resentment towards the Mughal government. As a result, opposition to his rule began to grow, making it difficult to maintain stability and control.

Other Reasons
After Aurangzeb's death, the Mughal Emperors who followed were known for their extravagant lifestyles. They spent money lavishly without concern for the Empire’s finances, which contributed to a weakening economy and made the Empire more vulnerable to internal and external threats.

Another major issue was the lack of a clear system of succession. Without a fixed line of succession, there were constant power struggles and in-fighting between Aurangzeb’s successors. This led to political instability and weakened the central authority of the Empire.

Additionally, the rise of strong regional powers such as the Marathas posed a significant challenge. The Marathas were skilled Hindu warriors who defeated a Mughal army in 1737 and took control of Delhi along with vast territories stretching towards Bengal. By 1760, the Mughals were powerless to stop them.

Finally, the Mughal military was outdated in comparison to that of the British. As the British expanded rapidly across the subcontinent, the Mughals lacked both the resources and the modern equipment to resist them effectively. This made it easier for the British to take control and further contributed to the decline of the Empire.

Evaluation
In conclusion, while Aurangzeb’s policies did play a significant role in initiating the decline of the Mughal Empire by creating division and unrest, the broader collapse of the Empire was also due to a combination of poor leadership after his death, economic mismanagement, military inferiority, and the rise of rival powers like the Marathas and the British. The decline was not caused by one factor alone but by a series of interconnected problems that weakened the Mughal Empire over time."
2020,Section B,General History,3 (a) Who was General Dyer?,4,"General Dyer was a British commander in India. In early 1919, after demonstrations in Amritsar, he moved troops there to restore order following riots. On April 13th, 1919, Dyer ordered his troops to confront a peaceful gathering of thousands of people in the Jallianwala Bagh, a public park. The troops opened fire, killing many people. As a result of his cruel actions, Dyer was later removed from command."
2020,Section B,Khilafat & Non-Cooperation Movement,(b) Explain why the Khilafat Movement ended in 1924.,7,"Gandhi called off his support for the Khilafat Movement following the Chauri Chaura incident. This caused both Muslim and Hindu groups to stop working together to further the Movement, weakening its strength and momentum.

In 1920, many Muslims set off on a hijrat to Afghanistan, hoping to find refuge. However, the Afghan government did not welcome them as they had expected. When the migrants returned home, they found their property and jobs had been occupied, which reduced their interest in supporting the Movement. For them, it was more important to restore their lives to normality.

The new Turkish leader, Kemal Ataturk, played a crucial role in ending the Khilafat Movement. He exiled the Khalifa and abolished the institution of the Caliph in 1924, bringing an end to the Movement."
2020,Section B,Partition of Bengal,(c) How successful was the 1905 Partition of Bengal? Explain your answer.,14,"Success of Partition in 1905
Bengal was the largest province in India, with a population of 84 million, 54 million of whom were Hindu. The province had become too large and complex for the British to efficiently govern. By dividing Bengal into two smaller provinces, the British were able to administer the region more effectively, with less administrative burden. Furthermore, the partition pleased the Muslim community. After the division, the Muslim population in East Bengal, where they were the majority, felt fully recognized and represented. Additionally, the separation of Bengal along religious lines ended the oppression that Muslims had been experiencing under Hindu rule, providing them with more autonomy.

Lack of Success of Partition in 1905
On the other hand, many Bengali Hindu groups strongly objected to the partition. They viewed it as part of a deliberate British ""divide and rule"" policy. The Hindus believed that the partition would weaken their unity and influence, especially in East Bengal, where they had been an influential community. As a result, numerous Hindu protests erupted, pressuring the British government to reconsider their decision. One of the most extreme responses to the partition was the attempted assassination of Lord Minto, which reflected the intensity of opposition. Additionally, the 'Swadeshi Movement' gained momentum as a form of resistance, with boycotts of British goods. This movement ultimately succeeded in its goal of challenging British authority and influence in the region.

Evaluation
In conclusion, while the partition initially succeeded in terms of British administrative efficiency and Muslim recognition in East Bengal, it was ultimately unsuccessful due to the strong opposition from the Hindu population, the resulting protests, and the Swadeshi Movement. The opposition showed that the division failed to address the underlying unity of the region, and the backlash played a significant role in the reversal of the decision. The partition of Bengal in 1905 is thus seen as a short-term success for the British but a long-term failure due to the unrest it caused."
2020,Section B,General History,4 (a) What was the ‘Day of Deliverance’?,4,"On 22 December 1939, Jinnah called on the Muslim community to celebrate the end of Congress rule. He appealed to all local and provincial district Muslim Leagues to hold public meetings to support this declaration. Jinnah asked that these gatherings be held calmly and with humility. In response, Congress objected to this celebration, seeing it as a direct challenge to their authority and the political status quo."
2020,Section B,Government of India Act 1935,(b) Explain why there was opposition to the Government of India Act of 1935.,7,"The Government of India Act of 1919 had several reasons behind its partial success and limitations. One reason it was considered exclusive and elitist was because only 25% of the population were eligible to vote, due to the property qualification. This severely limited the participation of the broader population, which created a sense of inequality. Another reason for criticism was that, although ministers in the provinces appeared to have control over departments, the real power still lay with the Provincial Governors. These governors could intervene in public order issues or veto bills they disliked, which meant that the Indian ministers had limited authority. Lastly, the British retained key decisions related to external relations and defense. This was a significant drawback for Indian groups who aspired to have greater control over their own affairs, as it highlighted the continuing dominance of British rule in critical areas."
2020,Section B,General History,(c) Assess the significance of the contributions of Allama Iqbal and Rahmat Ali to the Pakistan Movement. Explain your answer.,14,"Allama Iqbal and Rahmat Ali made significant contributions to the Pakistan Movement, although their approaches and impacts were somewhat different.

Allama Iqbal's contributions were profound in terms of intellectual influence and the awakening of Muslim consciousness. Through his poetry, Iqbal awakened a sense of nationhood among the Muslim community. He encouraged them to pursue a distinctive Islamic path that rejected the capitalist model, resonating deeply with many Muslims who sought a separate identity. Iqbal's opposition to British rule was pivotal, as he was the first prominent Muslim leader to advocate for the creation of a separate Muslim state. His famous Allahabad address in 1930 marked a critical turning point, as it presented the idea of an independent Muslim state for the first time, planting the seeds of what would eventually become Pakistan. His vision also influenced Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who later adopted many of Iqbal's ideas, leading the Muslim League and becoming the driving force behind Pakistan’s creation. Iqbal’s philosophical and intellectual contributions were vital in forming the ideological foundation for the Pakistan Movement.

On the other hand, Rahmat Ali's contributions, while important, were more directly political. In 1933, Rahmat Ali, along with other students, produced the influential pamphlet ""Now or Never,"" which argued for the partition of the subcontinent to create a Muslim homeland. His idea of a separate Muslim state, which he named ""Pakistan,"" resonated with many and became the rallying cry for later movements. Rahmat Ali’s formation of the Pakistan National Movement was another significant step, as it actively campaigned for the creation of Pakistan. His vision became more widely supported by the Muslim League by 1940, especially with their Lahore Resolution demanding a separate Muslim state. However, Rahmat Ali’s direct approach and criticisms of other leaders, such as Jinnah, made him unpopular among some Muslim factions. He criticized Jinnah for compromising on the interests of Muslim communities in areas like Delhi and Bengal, especially under the terms of partition in 1947.

Both Iqbal and Rahmat Ali played crucial roles in the conceptualization and eventual creation of Pakistan. However, Iqbal's influence was more philosophical and ideological, whereas Rahmat Ali's efforts were more focused on the practical and political aspects of establishing Pakistan. Iqbal's ideas laid the groundwork for the movement, while Rahmat Ali's activism helped to solidify the demand for a separate Muslim state."
2020,Section B,Jinnah's 14 Points,5 (a) Who was Fatima Jinnah?,4,"Fatima Jinnah was the sister of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, a dentist by profession who gave up her career to support him, especially after the death of his wife. In 1965, at the age of 71, she stood in the presidential election against Ayub Khan. Fatima Jinnah was very popular and, because of her immense contribution to the nation, she is remembered as Khatoon-i-Pakistan (First Lady of Pakistan) and Madar-i-Millat (Mother of the Nation)."
2020,Section B,Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto,(b) Explain why Benazir Bhutto’s government ended in 1996.,7,"Benazir Bhutto’s government faced significant challenges during her time in office. One of the reasons for its lack of success was the opposition’s efforts to undermine her government. The Pakistan Muslim League (PML) organized strikes, marches, and critical speeches, which reduced the efficiency of the government. In response, the PPP arrested senior PML leaders, which only served to escalate opposition and increase public dissent.

Additionally, Benazir Bhutto was criticized for not fulfilling her campaign promises, particularly the ""Agenda for Change,"" which had promised to improve social services and implement measures for women. The failure to bring about significant changes in these areas made her government unpopular and eroded public support, leading to dissatisfaction among the people.

Furthermore, despite efforts to sell off nationalized industries, her government struggled to address Pakistan’s pressing economic issues. This failure to overcome economic problems, particularly in the face of growing debt and inflation, diminished the credibility of the PPP government.

Lastly, the government lacked internal unity, as there were well-publicized family disputes over control of the PPP, further weakening its position and ability to govern effectively. These internal conflicts distracted from the government's agenda and contributed to its overall lack of success."
2020,Section B,General History,(c) Was the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) the main reason for the government ending in 1993? Explain your answer.,14,"The collapse of the BCCI bank in 1991 was a major factor in the government's downfall in 1993. The bank’s collapse led to investors losing large sums of money, which severely harmed Pakistan's financial system. This caused widespread public dissatisfaction and led to a loss of political support for the government, which was unable to manage the crisis effectively.

In addition to the BCCI collapse, there were other significant reasons for the government’s downfall. The end of the Soviet-Afghan war in the late 1980s resulted in the reduction of US aid that Pakistan had relied on during the conflict. This led to severe economic problems for the country, as the government struggled to manage the financial loss.

Furthermore, US aid was further restricted after the USA attempted to pressure Pakistan into abandoning its nuclear program. This external pressure not only hurt Pakistan’s economy but also created political tensions, diminishing the government’s credibility and support among the population.

Additionally, Pakistan’s involvement in supporting Afghan warlords during the Soviet-Afghan war had long-lasting effects. The proliferation of firearms, alongside the influx of refugees, led to an increase in crime, including kidnappings and murder. The resulting social instability further eroded the government's standing, especially in urban areas where these problems were most acute.

The government also lost public support due to the ‘Cooperative Societies scandal’. In Punjab, 700,000 people lost their savings when the state cooperative society went bankrupt, creating widespread anger and distrust toward the ruling party.

Lastly, the introduction of the Shariat Bill created divisions within the ruling alliance and among opposition groups. While some factions wanted Islam to play a greater role in government, others wanted a more secular approach. This internal division weakened the government and contributed to its inability to maintain power, as the debate over the role of Islam in governance became a point of contention.

In conclusion, while the collapse of the BCCI bank was a major trigger for the downfall of the government, it was the combination of economic crises, loss of US support, rising crime, and internal political divisions that ultimately led to the government's collapse in 1993."
2021,Section A,Kashmir Dispute,"(a) According to Source A, what were the reasons for India supporting Britain in the First World War?",3,"""In defence of an Empire,"" to fight ""a common enemy,"" ""India has always been loyal,"" India's ""future development in terms of prosperity,"" and India's recognition of ""our rights as citizens."""
2021,Section A,Kashmir Dispute,(b) What can we learn from Source B about the British presence in India at this time?,5,"There is a ceremony or coronation taking place, with many soldiers present. Some buildings can be seen, and the soldiers are standing to attention or on parade, organised into rows and holding guns. A crowd of civilians is gathered to watch the ceremony.

This scene suggests an important occasion or ceremony, likely a formal and organised event. It appears that Indian soldiers are showing loyalty to the monarchy, and it indicates that the British presence in India was powerful. The large crowd of Indian people seems eager to be part of the occasion.

Contextually, the King and Queen are the new Emperor and Empress of India, and the British maintained a significant army in India, with a large number of Indians serving in the British army. This was the first imperial coronation to take place on Indian soil."
2021,Section A,General History,(c) Explain the importance of the Lucknow Pact of 1916.,7,"A pact was made between the Muslim League and Congress, with both parties hoping that self-government was achievable. The Muslim League recognized the benefit of working with Congress, and for the first time, the two parties cooperated. However, this cooperation was short-lived, as they never worked together again. Despite their differences, Congress accepted the principle of separate electorates for the Muslim community."
2021,Section A,Kashmir Dispute,(d) To what extent had India benefited by the early 1920s from supporting Britain in the First Explain your answer.,10,"India benefitted by supporting the British in the First World War, particularly because, in 1917, it was promised a greater say in government. This was followed by the 1918 report that suggested India might eventually achieve self-government. Additionally, the Government of India Act 1919, which was introduced as a result of India’s support during the war, included provisions for separate electorates for various communities, giving them more political representation.

However, there were significant counter-arguments to the claim that India benefitted from supporting Britain. The Government of India Act 1919 still retained most of the political power in British hands, meaning that India did not achieve full self-rule. Moreover, not all minority groups were granted separate electorates, and some, like the Untouchables, were left out of this system of representation. Furthermore, the Rowlatt Act of 1919 imposed severe restrictions on the Indian population, allowing the British to arrest individuals without trial and curbing basic freedoms, leading to widespread discontent.

In conclusion, while India's support for the British during the First World War brought some political concessions, such as greater representation and the promise of eventual self-government, these reforms were limited and did not provide Indians with true autonomy. The continued British control, particularly highlighted by the Rowlatt Act, left many dissatisfied, undermining the argument that India truly benefitted from the war effort. Thus, India’s benefits from supporting Britain were mixed at best."
2021,Section B,General History,2 (a) Describe the achievements of Ranjit Singh.,4,"Ranjit Singh annexed Punjab, Kashmir, and most of Afghanistan. He was a key founder of Sikh rule in the Punjab, establishing a strong and influential empire in the region. In 1809, he signed a treaty with Britain in Sindh, solidifying a diplomatic relationship with the British. However, his expansion into Afghanistan raised concerns for Britain, as it increased the proximity of a powerful regional force near British interests in India, leading to heightened tensions."
2021,Section B,Jinnah's 14 Points,(b) Explain why Muhammad Ali Jinnah chose Urdu as the national language of Pakistan.,7,"Muhammad Ali Jinnah chose Urdu as the national language of Pakistan for several key reasons. First, Urdu was widely spoken and understood across different regions of Pakistan, making it a practical choice for communication and national unity. Jinnah believed that Urdu could serve as a unifying force, bridging the cultural and linguistic divides among the various ethnic groups in Pakistan.

Moreover, Urdu had strong associations with the Pakistan Movement, as it was the language used by many prominent leaders and activists advocating for the creation of Pakistan. This historical connection gave the language political and symbolic significance. Additionally, Urdu boasted a rich literary heritage, which added to its cultural value and prestige.

Finally, Urdu had important links to Islam, which further solidified its role in Pakistan, a country founded on the basis of Islam. The language’s connection to Islamic traditions, religious texts, and poetry made it especially meaningful in the context of Pakistan’s identity as an Islamic state. These factors combined to make Urdu the ideal choice as the national language, representing the unity, culture, and religious identity of the newly formed nation."
2021,Section B,General History,(c) ‘The work of Shah Waliullah was the main factor contributing to the spread of Islam between How far do you agree with this statement? Explain your answer.,14,"I agree to an extent that Shah Waliullah’s work played a significant role in the spread of Islam between 1700 and 1850, but there were other important factors contributing to this spread as well.

Shah Waliullah’s efforts were crucial in revitalizing Islam in the subcontinent. He aimed to stop the decline of Islam, which was facing internal divisions and external pressures during that period. He promoted Islamic values through his writings and education, which reached a broad audience. His translation of the Quran into Persian made the holy text more accessible to people who spoke Persian, broadening its reach and influence. Additionally, Shah Waliullah sought to unite different Muslim sects, which were divided at the time, under a common understanding of Islam. This unification was vital for strengthening the Muslim community and spreading Islamic teachings effectively.

However, there were other significant movements and leaders who also contributed to the spread of Islam during this period. The Jihad Movement, led by Syed Ahmad Barelvi, played an important role in uniting Muslims against non-Muslim rule and spreading Islamic influence in various regions of the subcontinent. Syed Ahmad Barelvi founded an army called the Mujahideen to fight for the faith, which helped to spread Islam in the North-Western regions. Moreover, the Faraizi Movement, led by Haji Shariatullah, sought to reform the practice of Islam by emphasizing the need to abandon non-Muslim practices. This movement also attracted many followers and contributed to the spread of Islam.

While Shah Waliullah’s intellectual contributions were foundational and had a long-lasting impact, it is clear that other religious leaders and movements played significant roles in the expansion and consolidation of Islam in the subcontinent between 1700 and 1850. Therefore, while Shah Waliullah’s work was undeniably important, it was not the sole factor in the spread of Islam during this period."
2021,Section B,General History,3 (a) Describe what happened at Allahabad in 1930.,4,"Allama Iqbal chaired a meeting of the Muslim League in Allahabad, where he delivered his famous presidential address. In this address, he called on all Muslims to work towards achieving a separate homeland. He argued that Islam united Muslims into one nation and that there could be no peace unless they were recognized as such. Furthermore, Iqbal proposed that certain areas, such as Punjab, NWFP, or Balochistan, should be amalgamated into a separate state. This address played a key role in shaping the vision for a separate Muslim homeland, which later became Pakistan.







"
2021,Section B,Sir Syed Ahmed Khan & Aligarh Movement,(b) Explain why the Muslim League was formed in 1906.,7,"The Muslim League was formed in 1906 primarily to unite the Muslim community in India. At the time, Hindu groups had their own political party, the Indian National Congress, which was gaining momentum in the struggle for Indian self-government. There was growing concern among Muslims that the increasing influence of these Hindu groups would lead to the dominance of the Hindu community, leaving Muslims marginalized. This fear was compounded by the fact that Hindu groups were advocating for their own language and cultural rights, which were perceived as potentially undermining the position of Muslims.

The success of the Muslim community during the Simla Deputation in 1906, where they secured promises from the British government regarding their political rights and representation, further reinforced the need for a united Muslim front. The formation of the Muslim League was seen as a response to these concerns, aiming to safeguard the political, cultural, and religious rights of Muslims in India. The League was established to provide Muslims with a platform to represent their interests, particularly in light of the growing influence of Hindu nationalist movements."
2021,Section B,War of Independence 1857,(c) To what extent were the outcomes of the War of Independence beneficial for India? Explain your answer.,14,"The outcomes of the War of Independence in 1857 were beneficial for India in some ways, but also had significant drawbacks. One of the major positive outcomes was the abolition of the Doctrine of Lapse, a policy that allowed the British East India Company to annex territories where the ruler had no male heir. This was a major grievance for Indian rulers, and its removal helped restore some degree of autonomy to native princely states. Additionally, the East India Company, which had long been in control of India, was dissolved after the rebellion, and India came under direct British rule, often referred to as the British Raj. This transition led to the implementation of various reforms, such as the introduction of irrigation schemes that benefitted Indian farmers, improving agricultural productivity. New farming methods were introduced, which were intended to increase crop yields, and the railway network was extended, helping to improve transportation and communication across the subcontinent.

However, the rebellion also had negative consequences that cannot be ignored. The British carried out harsh reprisals, including mass executions and the destruction of villages, which caused immense suffering to the Indian population. The Mughal Emperor, who had been a symbolic figurehead of Indian unity, was banished, ending the Mughal dynasty. The power of Indian princes was significantly reduced as they lost much of their influence and autonomy under British control. Furthermore, the rebellion disrupted trade and business, leading to economic instability and hardship for many people. The effects of this disruption were long-lasting, impacting India’s economy for years.

In conclusion, while the outcomes of the War of Independence led to some infrastructural and agricultural improvements, the harsh British reprisals, political changes, and economic disruptions resulted in negative consequences for India as well. Therefore, the benefits were mixed, and the overall impact of the rebellion on India was both positive and negative."
2021,Section B,General History,4 (a) Describe the terms of the Simla Agreement.,4,"The Simla Agreement was signed in July 1972 between Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, and Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India. Under the terms of the agreement, India agreed to return prisoners of war who had been captured during the 1971 war. Both countries also pledged to engage in bilateral discussions on the Kashmir issue, without involving third-party organizations like the United Nations."
2021,Section B,Sir Syed Ahmed Khan & Aligarh Movement,(b) Explain why Congress and the Muslim League opposed the Cripps Mission of 1942.,7,"Congress and the Muslim League opposed the Cripps Mission of 1942 for several reasons. The Muslim League was dissatisfied with the plan because it did not include a clear reference to the establishment of Pakistan, which was a major demand at the time. On the other hand, Congress opposed the mission because they wanted immediate control over India rather than the gradual steps outlined in the Cripps proposals. Congress also doubted whether the British would actually deliver on the promises made in the plan, given their weak position due to World War II. Moreover, Congress aimed to exploit Britain’s vulnerable situation by demanding more immediate action."
2021,Section B,General History,(c) ‘Ayub Khan’s agricultural policies were the most effective of the domestic reforms that took How far do you agree with this statement? Explain your answer.,14,"Ayub Khan’s agricultural policies were among the most effective of the domestic reforms implemented between 1958 and 1969. His land redistribution policy, which aimed to give land to tenant farmers, was a significant step in addressing the imbalance of land ownership in rural areas. Additionally, by providing loans to farmers, he facilitated investment in modern agricultural practices, leading to an increase in farming productivity. The introduction of irrigation schemes and the mechanization of farming also played a crucial role in boosting agricultural output and ensuring more efficient use of resources. These reforms led to improved conditions for many farmers and a growth in agricultural production.

However, counter-arguments suggest that Ayub Khan’s agricultural policies were not the only effective domestic reforms during his rule. For instance, his industrial policies were also successful, with the establishment of an oil refinery in Karachi and the setting up of a Mineral Development Corporation. Economic growth was spurred by such developments, and the introduction of an export bonus scheme encouraged production for export. Moreover, Ayub Khan focused on broader aspects of development, including the construction of new houses, the introduction of new schools and a new curriculum, as well as the establishment of medical facilities. The creation of Islamabad as a new capital and the implementation of the Basic Democracy Scheme further contributed to his domestic agenda.

While Ayub Khan's agricultural reforms were undoubtedly impactful, the overall effectiveness of his domestic policies cannot be attributed solely to this sector, as other policies, particularly those related to industrial and infrastructural development, also played a key role in the nation's growth."
2021,Section B,General History,5 (a) Describe the main events of Muhammad Khan Junejo’s political career.,4,"Muhammad Khan Junejo's political career included several key events. Zia-ul-Haq chose him as Prime Minister in 1985, a position he held as part of efforts to consolidate power after the military regime. Junejo worked to develop the new Muslim League party during his tenure, strengthening his political base. In 1988, he called an all-Party Conference to discuss the Afghan situation, emphasizing Pakistan's role in regional politics. That same year, Junejo announced an inquiry into an explosion at the army's weapons dump, the Ojhri Camp, and promised justice for those affected. However, despite these efforts, he was dismissed from office by Zia-ul-Haq on 29 May 1988, marking the end of his tenure as Prime Minister."
2021,Section B,General History,(b) Explain why there were changes of government between 1951 and 1958.,7,"Between 1951 and 1958, Pakistan experienced changes of government due to several key factors. The deaths of Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Liaquat Ali Khan left a leadership vacuum, with the remaining politicians being inexperienced and struggling to guide the country effectively. In 1953, a severe drought caused food shortages, which exacerbated the hardships faced by the population. This led to widespread discontent, culminating in riots and social unrest. Additionally, in 1955, East Pakistan experienced severe floods, further causing food shortages and deepening regional frustrations. These challenges contributed to instability, making it difficult for the government to maintain control and ultimately leading to multiple changes in leadership during this period."
2021,Section B,Independence and Partition,(c) ‘Pakistan has had good relations with the United States since 1947.’ How far do you agree with this statement? Explain your answer.,14,"The statement that Pakistan has had good relations with the United States since 1947 is partially true, but it requires context to fully understand the complexities of the relationship.

On one hand, Pakistan has enjoyed positive relations with the USA at several points in history. For example, Pakistan signed the Mutual Defence Assistance Agreement with the United States in 1954, signaling the beginning of a strategic partnership. Additionally, Pakistan joined SEATO (Southeast Asia Treaty Organization) in 1955, which further cemented its ties with the United States during the Cold War. Under Ayub Khan, Pakistan allowed the USA to build air bases on its soil, and in the 1980s, the USA provided significant military aid packages, including $1.6 billion spread over five years in 1981 and $4.2 billion in 1986. Relations were further strengthened when the USA restored sales of aircraft to Pakistan in 1993, and key political figures like First Lady Hillary Clinton and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto visited each other's countries in the mid-1990s. In 1996, the USA reimbursed Pakistan for F-16 payments and provided military equipment worth $388 million.

However, there were several periods of tension that affected the relationship. In 1962, the USA provided military assistance to India during its war with China, which caused Pakistan to turn toward China for support. Moreover, the USA imposed an arms embargo on both India and Pakistan in 1965, which was a setback for the bilateral relationship. During Zia-ul-Haq's rule, U.S. aid was suspended in 1977 and 1979 due to concerns over human rights and democracy. Furthermore, after the Afghan conflict in the 1980s, the USA blocked aid to Pakistan and refused to declare the country nuclear-free. In 1992, the USA imposed economic sanctions on Pakistan, and the relationship soured further after Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in 1998, which the USA strongly condemned.

In conclusion, while there have been periods of strong cooperation between Pakistan and the United States, there have also been significant strains due to issues such as military alliances, nuclear policies, and regional tensions. Therefore, while there have been moments of good relations, these have often been interrupted by periods of discord and disagreement."

Explain your answer.,10,"Gandhi wanted central government to have control over defence and foreign policy. Jinnah thought such matters should be in the hands of local government and provinces. Gandhi felt that partition should not be discussed until after the British left India. Jinnah wanted partition before the British left as Congress were unlikely to agree to it once the British had gone. Gandhi considered himself to be speaking for all of India. Jinnah reminded him that, as a Hindu, Gandhi was only the spokesman of Congress. Gandhi and Jinnah disagreed over the Two-Nation Theory which had become official Muslim League policy."

To take advantage of the support given by the British Liberal government to the Muslim community. To promote the political rights and identity of the Muslim community. The Simla Deputation achieved the promise of separate electorates propelling the Muslim community towards the formation of the All-India Muslim League. The promise of other political reforms created a window of Muslim opportunity to establish its own political party. The partition of Bengal was a problem for Congress. There had been a growth in Hindu activism. The Hindi-Urdu controversy and the Two-Nation Theory were other reasons.

Industrial reform led to inflation falling from 25 percent in 1972 to 6 percent in 1976. Introduction of security of tenure for agricultural tenants and a ceiling on land ownership. However, the new constitution placed all political power with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. The reform of the armed forces was opposed. Health policy inadvertently led to chemists’ profits falling. Education reforms led to overcrowding in schools. Many of these policies would take decades to become fully effective. The newly nationalised industries became overly bureaucratic.

2024,Section A,General History,"(d) ‘Political factors, such as the Doctrine of Lapse, were more significant than economic factors Explain your answer.",10,"The Doctrine of Lapse meant local kingdoms were administered by the British. The taking of Oudh under British control in 1856 was unpopular with Indian people. There was frustration at the lack of opportunities in the civil service. The Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah and his family were mistreated.

However, the British kept the salary of sepoys low which was unpopular among the troops. The British imposed high taxation that many Indians could not afford. The East India Company banned the export of cotton goods from India in 1800. Poverty spread amongst the Indian people causing unrest."

2024,Section B,Mughal Empire,(c) ‘The Mughal Empire ended because its military power declined.’ How far do you agree with this statement? Explain your answer.,14,"Continual fighting against rebels in multiple locations meant military strength grew weaker over time. The cost of putting down rebellions and fighting invaders meant that there were fewer resources available to modernise the army. Military expertise declined during the latter stages of Mughal rule leaving the Empire more vulnerable to attack. However, the size of the empire made it difficult to administer. Local leaders increasingly challenged Mughal power. Previously loyal princes rebelled against Mughal authority. There were uprisings by the Marathas and Sikhs. The absence of a definite line of succession led to succession disputes. Money was wasted when Emperors died and there was a succession dispute. There were disputes between wealthy Mughal nobility. The Empire came under almost constant attack from Persia and Afghanistan. The arrival of the British with their military strength also contributed to the collapse."

2024,Section B,Sir Syed Ahmed Khan & Aligarh Movement,(c) To what extent was the introduction of Bande Mataram the main reason why Congress Rule (1937–1939) was unpopular with the Muslim community? Explain your answer.,14,"Bande Mataram was a nationalist Hindu song. Singing of the song was made compulsory before the start of business in provincial assemblies. These actions worried and offended the Muslim community as the song contained anti-Muslim messages. However, the introduction of the Wardha scheme or Basic Education scheme into Congress education ministries with teaching in Hindi also upset Muslims. Hindu culture was promoted in the curriculum. Muslims viewed these measures as an attempt to remove their identity and convert their children to Hinduism. Muslims living under Congress rule felt threatened as in some areas mosques were targeted and Muslim worship was disrupted. Hindu groups won more government business which harmed the income and trade of Muslim businesses."
2024,Section B,General History,4 (a) Describe the ‘One Unit’ Scheme.,4,"In 1954, Muhammad Ali Bogra had proposed that the four provinces and ten princely states within Pakistan should be joined together to form West Pakistan. In 1955, Iskander Mirza passed an order unifying all of West Pakistan in what became known as the ‘One Unit’ Scheme. Pakistan was divided into two wings, West and East Pakistan. Mirza claimed that the unification would bring about greater efficiency and a united country."
2024,Section B,Independence and Partition,(b) Explain why East Pakistan sought independence from West Pakistan in 1971.,7,The long distance from West Pakistan meant it was not treated as an equal part of Pakistan. The government introduced schemes such as the One Unit policy to deny East Pakistan fair representation in the Assembly. Cultural and linguistic differences were not fully recognised. It was under-represented in the Civil Service and the military. Government measures to boost the economy had favoured West Pakistan. It did not benefit from the wealth created by the growing of jute. The wealth gap and differences in health and education were growing. It received insufficient relief following the 1970 cyclone. The demands of the Awami League were not fully considered. The results of the 1971 election were not accepted.
2024,Section B,Independence and Partition,(c) ‘Pakistan has had good relations with China since 1947.’ How far do you agree with this statement? Explain your answer.,14,"Pakistan gave support for China joining the UN in 1952. Boundary issues between the two countries were settled in 1963. Trade developed in the 1960s particularly Pakistani cotton. A $60 million long term interest-free loan was provided regarding import of machinery. China permitted PIA to use any airport in 1963 despite opposition from the USA. Increased numbers of visitors from China including journalists, engineers, and scientists came to Pakistan. China gave Pakistan full support during the 1965 war and military aid. Post-war in 1972, Bhutto visited China and supportive relations were re-established. In 1978, the Karakoram Highway provided the first road link and opened the two countries up to trade and tourism. Zia’s visit to China in 1986 and the signature of a nuclear cooperation treaty emphasised the strength of the relationship. However, in the 1950s there was a cooling off when Pakistan supported pro-USA policies. There was a border dispute in the 1950s. In 1958/9, Pakistan voted against China’s admission to the UN and condemned military action in Tibet. During the 1971 war, China was unable to offer as much support to Pakistan. During the 1990s, China developed relations with other countries."
2024,Section B,General History,5 (a) Describe Sajjad Ali Shah’s role in the Pakistan governments of the 1990s.,4,"Sajjad Ali Shah was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court by Benazir Bhutto in 1994. During 1997, he became a critic of the new Prime Minister. In November 1997, demonstrations forced the Chief Justice to adjourn a case against the Prime Minister and flee the courthouse. He was dismissed as Chief Justice of Pakistan in December 1997, having lost President Leghari’s support. He was replaced by Ajmal Mian."
2024,Section B,Pakistan's Foreign Policy,(b) Explain why relations between Pakistan and the USA improved during the 1990s.,7,"There was a will from both countries to restore relations following a change in the US administration in 1992. The USA accepted the Pressler Amendment was a mistake. Benazir Bhutto visited the United States in 1996 to further develop relations, culminating in the Brown Amendment. The F-16 fighter jets issue was resolved. The USA provided $388 million in military supplies to Pakistan. The First Lady Hillary Clinton visited Pakistan in 1996 further strengthening the relationship."
2024,Section B,Zia-ul-Haq and Islamization,(c) ‘The main impact of the “Afghan Miracle” in Pakistan during Zia-ul-Haq’s presidency was on its economy.’ How far do you agree with this statement? Explain your answer.,14,"The USA provided a $1.6 billion aid package over five years. In 1986, a further $4.2 billion worth of aid was agreed. Some of this money was used to develop Pakistan’s economy and undertake economic reform. The economic growth rate of Pakistan increased. Between 1977–1986 the average GNP growth was 6.2%. Inflationary pressures grew. Politically, there was a stronger relationship with the USA. There was a deteriorating relationship with the USSR. Pakistan was established as a leading country on the global political stage. Socially, there was an increasing refugee crisis. There was funding for the rehabilitation of refugees. There were impacts on law and order. Militarily, $1.5 billion in funding from the USA was used to develop the Pakistan army into a leading military nation in the region. Pakistan built up an effective military force with modern weapons. Karachi became the leading naval base in the region. Pakistan sold military assistance to other Muslim countries."
