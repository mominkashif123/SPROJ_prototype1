The Nawab didn’t cover their cannon and muskets when it rained.
English soldiers knew how to prepare for battle in the rain better.
Nawab’s muskets were useless due to the wet powder.
Mir Jafar’s men unwilling to fight against the British.
Jafar had turned traitor/been corrupted by the British.
Nawab had 500 casualties to Clive’s 22.
It was raining.
The Nawab’s troops retreated."
2015,Section A,Kashmir Dispute,(b) What does Source B tell us about the British East India Company in 1825?,5,"The painter has made the British officer the largest figure to demonstrate the importance that they held in India. Similarly the Indians are shown as small people to reflect their lowly status; Local rulers are on horseback behind the British official. They are shown as smaller,
reflecting their lower status to the British; The horses are shown as large animals, graceful in appearance and movement, again
showing superiority and power. This is reinforced by soldiers on horses who were carrying
weapons; The East India Company is shown as being a wealthy organisation as seen in the uniforms
and the decorations on the horses. The Company were able to achieve this wealth through
trading as can be seen by the boat shown in the picture and through the gaining of lands
through conquest and agreements with local rulers. This is shown by the weapons displayed
and the wealthy appearance of the Indians that the British were also able to exploit"
2015,Section A,Kashmir Dispute,(c) Why were the British able to take control of India by 1850?,7,"The British built a huge network of roads and later railways that meant that communication and transport links between cities became better, soldiers could travel much more easily from trouble spot to trouble spot. It also benefitted British trading links which in turn produced more wealth. The battles of Plassey and Buxar also gave the British the vast riches of Bengal and favourable trading rights with the local nawabs. This provided massive new resources which Britain could use to consolidate its control. The British also introduced governorgenerals into the provinces who administered them on British lines and provided yet more control. The British army using its vast local resources and superior weapons and skills were increasingly taking control of more land."
2015,Section A,Kashmir Dispute,(d) Was the work of the Christian missionaries the most important reason why the Indians,10,"Christian missionaries came to India to convert the local population as well as to set up
schools. In these schools the missionaries taught Christianity and expected local religions to
be given up which was resented by Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs alike.
However, there were other reasons why the Indians opposed the British attempts to
westernise them. The replacement of Persian and Sanskrit by English as the official
language in the 1830s deeply upset both the Muslims and Hindus. This had the potential to
threaten their languages. A number of social reforms had been imposed by the British
without consultation or care for local feeling which caused much unrest. Indians had to send
their children to co-educational schools which was hated since it appeared to impose the
British system on the Indians without due regard to their religious and cultural feelings.
Thomas Macaulay believed that European ideas of education were vastly superior to
anything coming out of India and, as a result, the British imposed a system of education that
promoted western values on a people who resented this interference. They were also forced
to abandon purdha which had been an Indian custom for centuries. In 1795 the killing of
baby daughters was declared to be murder, but the British found difficulty in enforcing this as
it was again a tradition practised in many parts of India. Suttee, the ritual burning of Indian
women on the funeral pyres of their husbands was also banned by the British, first in Bengal
and then in the rest of the country. Although the British had been reluctant to get involved in
banning this practice, there was little opposition to the outlawing of it. "
2015,Section B,General History,(a) Who was Tipu Sultan?,4,"Son of Haider Ali of Mysore, both of whom resisted British rule. Tipu received support from
the French and the British were concerned about this. He was known as the Tiger of Mysore
and ruled there from 1782 to 1799. He won important victories against the British in the
Second Anglo-Mysore War, and negotiated the 1784 Treaty of Mangalore with them after his
father died the previous year. His treatment of his conquered non-Muslim subjects and
British prisoners of war is controversial. He remained an enemy of the British, bringing them
into renewed conflict with an attack on Travancore in 1789. In the Third Anglo-Mysore War,
Tipu was forced into a humiliating treaty, losing a number of previously conquered territories,
including Malabar and Mangalore. In the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, the combined forces of
the British and the Nizam of Hyderabad defeated Tipu and he was killed on 4 May 1799,
while defending his fort of Srirangapatna. "
2015,Section B,Independence and Partition,(b) Why was Urdu chosen as the national language in Pakistan in 1947?,7,"It carries immense importance for all Pakistanis since it has been considered to be the
language of all Muslims for 300 years. It was the language associated with the Pakistani
Movement throughout its struggle with the British and the Hindus. After Independence, it was
felt that the language was the uniting force behind the nation and the government is
committed to using it at all levels in society. "
2015,Section B,General History,(c) Was the attempt to achieve a better understanding with the British the most important century? Explain your answer.,14,"He suggested that the British should try to understand Muslims better. He gave an
explanation of the word ‘Nadarath’ in an attempt to remove the misunderstanding of the
British about the Muslims. He believed that relations with the British could be improved by
improving the understanding of Christianity by Muslims. He tried to overcome this by writing
Tabyin-ul-Kalam, in which he pointed out the similarities between Islam and Christianity. He
wrote a number of books following the War of Independence in which he tried to show the
British that the Muslims were only partly to blame and that there were many who were
supporters of the British government. He was also aware that the British knew little about
Islam and was offended by a book he read in Britain on the life of the Prophet and, as a
result, he wrote his own work correcting the many errors he had read.
However, he contributed many other things. Sir Syed wanted democratic rights in India but
believed that this would only disadvantage Muslims since Hindus were in the majority and
would win all the elections. He therefore felt that the British should treat the Muslims and
Hindus differently since they lived separate and different lives from one another and so were
really like separate nations. Sir Syed was the first person to express this point of view and it
became known as the Two Nation Theory that gave hope to Muslims of a separate
homeland. He attempted to improve the position of Muslims through education. In 1863 he
founded the Scientific Society at Ghazipore. He wanted to make scientific writings available
to Muslims by translating them from English into Urdu. He established a Muslim college
which led to the Muslim-Anglo Oriental College in 1876. This became the University of
Aligarh which became important in Pakistani history as providing an education for many of its
future leaders"
2015,Section B,Khilafat & Non-Cooperation Movement,(a) What was the All India Khilafat Conference?,4,"Held in Delhi in November 1919, led by Ali brothers who hoped to try and persuade the
British to keep their promises about maintaining the Turkish Empire. Maulana Abul Kalam
Azad and Gandhi represented Congress. Gandhi hoped to unite Hindus and Muslims in his
non-violent campaign against the British. Azad warned the Conference that David Lloyd
George intended to punish Turkey for fighting against Britain in the war. The Conference
passed a resolution agreeing to send a delegation to Britain, making sure they were aware of
the strength of Muslim support for the Khalifa. "
2015,Section B,Jinnah's 14 Points,(b) Why did Jinnah produce his 14 Points in 1929?,7,"The 14 Points set out the demands of any future negotiations with either Congress or the
British Government. The 14 Points also formed the basis of the Muslims’ demands for a
separate homeland. It also convinced them that the Hindus and Muslims were two separate
nations."
2015,Section B,General History,(c) How successful were the three Round Table Conferences of 1930-1932? Explain your answer.,14,The federal system for India was approved. Sind was given a separate identity and a government. Congress was attended. Minorities entered into an agreement on their demands. Congress was boycotted. There was a deadlock on the federal system. The minorities sub-committee couldn’t reach a conclusion. Gandhi took a hard line and refused to recognize the problems of the minorities. Muslims took a hard line against Congress to protect their position. The British National government was less keen to reach a compromise in India. Congress was absent again. The gulf between the two sides was too great.
2015,Section B,General History,(a) What was the ‘Afghan Miracle’?,4,"USSR’s invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 led to an immediate impact on Pakistan’s
relationship with other countries. Zia was seen as leader of a Muslim nation on the frontline
against communist forces. Economic and military support came from the West and Pakistan
became an important base against the Soviets. Pakistan became a leading country in world
politics and this led to huge sums of money coming into the country to pay for the care of
refugees and the armed forces. Zia was able to use some of the funds to make economic
progress and reform the economy. "
2015,Section B,General History,(b) Why was Islamabad chosen as the new capital of Pakistan?,7,"Government officials would be moved well away from the commercial districts of Karachi that
might have some unwanted influences on them. It was also seen as an appropriate
movement of the power base from the industrially and commercially developed south to the
underdeveloped Punjab region in the north. Ayub Khan wanted to be closer to the army’s
command headquarters in the north which he saw as vital in times of martial law. Karachi
had a very warm and humid climate and, as a port, it wasn’t felt that it represented the needs
of a capital city as the existing buildings were not adequate in number or up to the standards
required by a capital. The layout and structure of the existing port city did not allow it to take
on the functions of a modern capital. With its position on the coast, it was considered
vulnerable to attacks from the Arabian Sea. The vast influx of refugees intensified the
existing problems and created new ones. "
2015,Section B,Independence and Partition,(c) How successful was Pakistan in its relationship with the U.S.A. between 1947 and 1999? Explain your answer.,14,"Liaquat Ali Khan visits the United States. Pakistan is willing to join the US in an anti-communism pact in return for military aid. Pakistan joins SEATO and CENTO. Substantial military and economic aid is provided to Pakistan, amounting to $4.2 billion, making it the third highest recipient of US aid. Bhutto visits the US. Clinton restores sales of aircraft in return for Pakistan stopping the production of weapons-grade uranium. Bhutto visits the US and gains $388 million in military equipment. First Lady Hillary Clinton visits Pakistan. The US provides military aid to India during its war with China, placing strain on relations. Pakistan turns to China for friendship. The US places an arms embargo on India and Pakistan during their war, badly affecting Pakistan. Bhutto leaves SEATO. American aid is suspended and later suspended again. US aid falls dramatically, creating problems for Benazir Bhutto. US President George Bush blocks aid to Pakistan due to nuclear weapons. The US comes close to declaring Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism and places economic sanctions on the country. The US condemns Pakistan’s nuclear weapons tests."
2015,Section B,Kashmir Dispute,(a) What has been the importance of the Siachen Glacier to both India and Pakistan?,4,"1977 Indian colonel Kumar first climbed the glacier. Returned in 1981. Pakistan discovered
that Indians had been there and decided to defend its interests before India claimed the
glacier, especially as the border in that part of Kashmir had never been drawn properly.
When Pakistan soldiers moved up to the glacier they discovered 300 Indian troops there.
This meant that both sets of troops had to stay there as the glacier was an important symbol
to both sides. Pakistan tried several times to remove the Indian troops from there without
success. In 1987 Musharraf led one of these assaults. In 1989 Bhutto visited the glacier to
reinforce Pakistan’s view of it. No official figures exist of the death toll on the glacier with
estimates between 3000 and 5000, but many of these have probably been due to
avalanches and falls. No settlement has been reached, even though several meetings have
been held to discuss the situation since 1989. "
2015,Section B,General History,(b) Explain why General Musharraf was able to gain power in 1999.,7,"Sharif was giving support for the Taliban in Afghanistan and this damaged relations with USA
as they refused to hand over Osama bin Laden, suspected of bombing of US embassy in
Kenya. Pakistan also tested nuclear weapons which angered a number of countries which
then halted aid to Pakistan and brought Sharif much criticism. He also blamed Musharraf for
the embarrassing retreat from the fighting in Kashmir. The army refused to accept this
criticism. Sharif tried to sack Musharraf whilst he was visiting Sri Lanka and as a result the
army decided to intervene in the government and overthrew Sharif. "
2015,Section B,Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto,(c) How successful were Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto’s domestic policies between 1971 and 1977? Explain your answer.,14,"A new constitution drawn up in 1973 established a Senate which offered the opportunity for
professionals, academics and specialists to work together. It also safeguarded the interests
of minority provinces which now had equal status in the Senate. He produced the 1973
Constitution in an attempt to return to a form of parliamentary democracy and it was
important since it is the basis upon which Pakistan has been governed to the end of the 20th
century, apart from when it was suspended due to martial law.
He also tried to improve the infant mortality and age expectancy rates by introducing Rural
Health Centres and Basic Health Units. Pharmaceutical companies were banned from
charging for a particular medical brand name and so medicines became cheaper.
Amongst Bhutto’s education reforms, free primary education was introduced. New schools
were to be built and all private sector schools were nationalised. The aim was to increase the
literacy rate and raise academic standards. One of the main weaknesses of the new constitution was that the focal point of political
power lay with the party leadership and Bhutto in particular. When things went wrong, Bhutto
was blamed.
Banning pharmaceutical companies from charging for a medical brand and making
medicines cheaper did see the profits of chemists fall drastically and as a result many
international drug companies closed down their operations in Pakistan.
The changes in education led to overcrowding in existing schools while new ones were built.
The reforms were not very successful since the building of new schools and the recruitment
of new teachers could not be achieved quickly and was also very expensive. Many families
resented the reforms since it meant a loss of earnings for them. "
2016,Section A,General History,"(a) According to Source A, what problems were caused by Cyclone Bhola in 1970?",3,"It destroyed villages and crops. Nearly 1 million people died. 85% of the area was destroyed.
3 months later 75% of population were receiving food from aid workers. There were ill
feelings towards West Pakistan over the amount of aid "
2016,Section A,General History,(b) What does Source B tell us about the outcome of the conflict between East Pakistan and West Pakistan?,5,"It suggests that the ending of the conflict was an important event because there
are military men of high rank witnessing the signing of a peace treaty. The
source shows that the Indian army had become involved in the conflict. The end
of the conflict led to the formation of Bangladesh. The source suggests that this
news was important so would be broadcast around the subcontinent and
probably the world."
2016,Section A,Objective Resolution 1949,(c) Why did the victory of the Awami League in the 1970 elections in Pakistan cause a constitutional crisis?,7,"President Yahya Khan was not willing to allow the Awami League to take over
the National Assembly by forming a government. The Awami League had won a
landslide victory in East Pakistan and the National Assembly and was in a
position to form a government on its own. The future Prime Minister and the
entire cabinet could be formed from the Awami League. Even though Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto and the Pakistan People’s Party had won an overwhelming victory in
West Pakistan, it was likely it would have no role in the future government. The Awami League had won the election on a programme limiting the power of
central government over the provinces. The different areas of the country
wanted to have control over their foreign exchange earned from trade which
would subsequently reduce the funds to the central government in West
Pakistan."
2016,Section A,Fall of Dhaka 1971,(d) How successful have relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh been from 1971 to 1999? Explain your answer.,10,"In 1974 the Prime Minister Sheikh Mujib was invited to meeting of the
Organisation of Islamic Countries in Lahore. Pakistan agreed to officially
recognise Bangladesh. The countries agreed to view each other as Muslim
friends and to resolve their differences. In 1975/6 there was an exchange of
ambassadors and an agreement was reached to cooperate on trade, tourism
and the media. In 1986 trade between the two countries reached a value of $40
million. In 1985 and 1988 Pakistan was the first country to provide aid to
Bangladesh due to severe weather. Pakistan withdrew from Commonwealth and SEATO. Some non-Bengalis
reported facing persecution and deprivation in Bangladesh. In 1974 Zulfiqar Ali
Bhutto visited Bangladesh to discuss the redistribution of shared assets but
nothing was agreed. There was disagreement over the role of non-Bengalis in
Bangladesh."
2016,Section B,War of Independence 1857,2 (a) What happened at Cawnpore in 1857?,4,"Indian troops, led by Nana Sahib, rose up against the British, trapping their forces who
surrendered after 3 weeks. As they left, the British soldiers and 300 women and children
were killed the remainder were kept as prisoners and later killed. Later the British carried out
acts of revenge. Nana Sahib escaped. "
2016,Section B,Kashmir Dispute,(b) Explain the appeal of India to the East India Company during the early seventeenth century.,7,"Indian troops, led by Nana Sahib, rose up against the British, trapping their forces who
surrendered after 3 weeks. As they left, the British soldiers and 300 women and children
were killed the remainder were kept as prisoners and later killed. Later the British carried out
acts of revenge. Nana Sahib escaped. "
2016,Section B,General History,(c) Did Shah Waliullah contribute more to the spread of Islam than anyone else in the sub- continent before 1850? Explain your answer.,14,"Shah Waliullah: He felt that the Muslims faced many problems because of their level of knowledge about Islam and the Holy Quran. He encouraged them to concentrate on Quranic teachings and helped them by translating the Holy Quran into Persian which was the main language of the Muslims at that time.
His books were designed to spread the principles of Islam amongst Muslims.
Syed Ahmad: 
Spread Islam through the Jihad Movement, which was to become an armed
struggle to liberate the Punjab and the North West Frontier. It grew largely
because Muslims were banned from prayer and found it difficult to practise their
religion.
Haji Shariatullah: 
Spread Islam through the Faraizi Movement which encouraged Muslims to
perform their faraiz (religious obligations). This restored the pride in the
community. A huge group of followers grew called ‘Faraizis’.  "
2016,Section B,Kashmir Dispute,3 (a) What were the terms of the Indian Councils Act of 1909?,4,"Also known as the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909. The Imperial Council increased to 60
members by adding more non-official members. The British retained control. The Central
Executive Council increased by 60 members and could discuss matters of importance and
advise on government policies including the budget. Provincial Councils also increased to 50
members in larger provinces and 30 members in smaller provinces. Muslim representatives
to the Councils to be elected by a separate Muslim-only electorate."
2016,Section B,Partition of Bengal,(b) Explain why the British partitioned Bengal in 1905.,7,"Of the 54 million people in Bengal, 42 million were Hindus. It seemed sensible
to divide up the province on religious grounds. It was a very large province that
created significant administrative difficulties. The British felt that partition of the
province would make it easier to administer, especially at the time of a new
British government in power. The Hindu community saw it as a policy of ‘Divide
and Rule’, an attempt by the British to work against them. "
2016,Section B,Kashmir Dispute,(c) Was the introduction of the Rowlatt Act in 1919 the sole cause of violence in India during 1919 and 1920? Explain your answer.,14,"The Rowlatt Act:
This caused uproar in India because it appeared to go against the central
principles of British justice: trial by jury and safeguards against illegal
imprisonment. The measures were seen as being repressive, especially as
people could be made to live in a particular place and were stopped from
attending meetings. Strikes and demonstrations took place and the British made matters worse by introducing further measures such as banning anti-British
publications.
The Amritsar massacre:
This occurred in 1919 when a large group of Indians were shot dead and
injured, including women and children, for holding an illegal meeting. Although
General Dyer was reprimanded for ordering the shooting, his standing in the
British media was enhanced which offended Indians and resulted in further
violence.
The Government of India Act:
This implemented the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms in 1919, retaining most of
the power in India with central government, at a time when Indians following
their efforts in the First World War had been expecting greater delegation of
power. These measures were opposed, in some cases violently, and a deep
mistrust of the British government grew. Fundamentalist groups grew during the
early 1920s increasing communal violence between Hindus and Muslims"
2016,Section B,General History,4 (a) What was the ‘One Unit’ Scheme?,4,"Iskander Mirza (Acting Governor-General) introduced it in 1955 to unify all of West Pakistan.
He claimed it would bring about greater efficiency and enable more rapid development. West
Pakistan politicians and administrators feared their influence may be challengedif they did
not do this, especially as there were 10 million more people in East Pakistan. By unifying
West Pakistan and making West Pakistan and East Pakistan official with equal
representation in the Assembly, the One Unit Scheme prevented East Pakistan from gaining
a majority in the Assembly. This was very unpopular in East Pakistan."
2016,Section B,General History,(b) Explain why Ayub Khan introduced Martial Law in 1958.,7,"There were a number of Prime Ministers between 1956 and 1958 and it
reached a stage when General Ayub Khan felt the army should take control to
restore stability. East Pakistan’s politicians wanted more say in the running of
the central government which increased tension. Iskander Mirza had lost the
support of many of the leading politicians and was alarmed at a plan by
Suharwardy to unite the political leadership of Bengal and Punjab against him.
Therefore he turned to Ayub Khan and the military for help."
2016,Section B,Independence and Partition,(c) How successful was Pakistan in solving the problems of Partition during 1947 and 1948? Explain your answer.,14,"The Quaid-e-Azam Relief Fund was created to help refugees. Quaid-e-Azam
toured the provinces encouraging and motivating the people. He appealed to
the people to help the refugees. He declared himself ‘Protector-General’ of religious minorities. The State Bank of Pakistan was set up. Karachi was made
capital of Pakistan. The Civil Services were re-organised. Pakistan joined the
United Nations and attempted to draw their attention to Kashmir issue. The Kashmir and other Princely States issues were not resolved. The Canal
Water Dispute was not resolved until 1959. Millions were made homeless or
died as a result of partition. "
2016,Section B,Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto,5 (a) Describe Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s health reforms of 1972.,4,"Zulfikar Ali Bhutto introduced a health scheme in 1972 in which Rural Health Centres and
Basic Health Units in urban areas were to provide widespread healthcare. It expected to set
up 1 Rural Health Centre for every 60000 people and 1 Basic Health Unit for every 20000
people. Training colleges for doctors and nurses were expected to admit students on merit
and on qualification (after first year) they could be placed anywhere by the government. The
sale of branded medicines was banned in an attempt to reduce the cost of these and could
be purchased without prescription. However, the reforms were expensive and there was a
shortage of doctors and nurses. International drug companies closed down their operations
in Pakistan due to a lack of profits from unbranded medicines"
2016,Section B,Zia-ul-Haq and Islamization,(b) Why did Zia-ul-Haq find it difficult to rule Pakistan during the late 1980s?,7,"Zia-ul-Haq found difficulty in managing the breakdown of law and order.
Violence grew throughout the country with killings commonplace in cities such
as Karachi. Drug trafficking grew and there was an increase in levels of
corruption in society. The provinces became more difficult to administer. Sindh
had regular outbreaks of violence and there was a movement to break away
from Pakistan. The NWFP was also becoming more critical of the government.
The explosion at the arms dump at Camp Ojhri in 1988 led to Prime Minister
Junejo setting up an inquiry. Zia-ul-Haq could not tolerate this, so dismissed him
and dissolved the National Assembly. This led to a political crisis for Zia-ul-Haq."
2016,Section B,General History,(c) Was the Co-operative Societies scandal the most important reason why Nawaz Sharif fell from office in 1993? Explain your answer.,14,"Cooperative Societies scandal:
Mismanagement of the Societies led to loss of savings by millions of people.
Many of the Societies had granted huge loans to the Ittefaq Group this
damaged Nawaz Sharif’s reputation.
Kalashnikov culture:
There was easy availability of guns. There was crime, terrorism, kidnappings
and murder. There were issues associated with refugees from the SovietAfghan war. Drug addiction increased.
Economic measures:
Nawaz Sharif increased investment to provide jobs but few loans were repaid.
US aid ceased at the end of the Soviet-Afghan war.
BCCI scandal:
The collapse of BCCI bank in 1991 due to concerns about the bank’s lending
practices. Investors lost huge sums of money.
Shariat Bill:
There was some opposition to the increased role of religion in government.
Relations with President:
Nawaz Sharif disagreed with the President over the appointment of a new army
chief of staff and Eighth Amendment. "
2017,Section A,Kashmir Dispute,"(a) According to Source A, what difficulties did the Indian cotton industry face during the nineteenth century?",3,"Indian production of cotton goods was discouraged – in favour of British
industry.
Only allowed to grow raw cotton to supply British looms.
Skilled workers had to work in East India Company (EIC) factories.
EIC controlled Indian weaving production. Very high tariffs prevented Indian silk and cotton from entering Britain.
No duty on British goods reaching India. "
2017,Section A,Kashmir Dispute,(b) How does Source B help us to understand Indian concerns about the building of railways in India during the nineteenth century?,5,"It looks dangerous / unsafe to travel by rail due to the risk of derailment or
accident, which might cause injury and death.
Since railways were not built safely at first, accidents like these were
frequent in India.
Accidents like the one shown in the source made some people fear that
railways were dangerous. Some people also worried that the British were trying to change their way
of life."
2017,Section A,Kashmir Dispute,(c) Why did the British build railways in India during the nineteenth century?,7,"Railways transported raw materials easily/cheaply to the ports for export/
manufactured goods to be sold throughout India, increasing British profits.
Railways carried troops swiftly around India (helping the British to
maintain law and order and extend power).
 British could travel the country and spread their ideas / culture, gaining
support / to govern effectively.
In times of famine food could be transported quickly to affected areas.
To win support of Indians who found them useful for travel as families
were able to travel to visit relatives in other parts of India. "
2017,Section A,War of Independence 1857,(d) Was an absence of leadership the main reason why the War of Independence in 1857 failed? Explain your answer.,10,"No single leader e.g. Bhadur Shah was not accepted by most Hindus.
Many people at the time thought Bhadur Shah did not have strong
leadership skills and that he was more of a figurehead.
Bahadur Shah and the Rani of Jhansi worked alone, and neither would
support the other.
Lack of unity and common cause amongst the Indian population.
The Punjab was uninterested in helping the rebellion, sending men and
supplies to help the British.
Some of the Indian princes were more interested in restoring their own
powers and this often depended upon the support of the British. Muslims were more likely to oppose the British in the war but there was
not a sense of unity with Sikhs and Hindus who were less likely to support
them in their cause.
A series of uprisings against the British, the Indians were not as
coordinated or strong so the British overcame them.
The British had modern methods of fighting.
The British army was well disciplined and supplied by some of the local
rulers.
The British used diplomatic as well as military mechanisms to limit the
extent of the conflict. "
2017,Section B,General History,2 (a) Who were zamindars?,4,"Landlords/tax collectors.
Wealthy and influential, some had private armies.
After death of Aurangzeb they were increasingly unwilling to accept rule of
any new emperor or to make payments to government in Delhi.
Beard tax imposed which annoyed Muslims.
Muslims were oppressed by zamindars from the 1800’s onwards,
especially in East Bengal. "
2017,Section B,General History,(b) Why was Robert Clive appointed the first Governor of Bengal?,7,"Clive commanded the British army to victory at the battle of Plassey in
1757 and established relations with Mir Jafar.
The battle increased Clive’s reputation and his importance to the East
India Company (EIC) because he became the foremost commander of
British forces in India.
The battle was also a success for the EIC because they now controlled
the profitable trade in Bengal.
As a reward for being considered responsible for the EIC amassing
immense fortunes, especially in Bengal
Clive’s reputation and importance was further enhanced by his success at
the battle of Buxar in 1764 which increased British control of eastern
India. "
2017,Section B,Mughal Empire,(c) Was the in-fighting between Aurangzeb’s successors the most important reason for the break‑up of the Mughal Empire? Explain your answer.,14,"The absence of a definite line of succession led to in-fighting, instability
and the downfall of the Mughal Empire.
Led to inefficiencies and a lack of interest in the running of the Mughal
Empire. As the Mughal Empire started to decline it became at risk from invasion.
After Aurangzeb’s death, Mughal emperors were renowned for living an
extravagant lifestyle and spending money without considering the effect
on the economy of the Empire.
The Afghans under the leadership of Ahmad Shah Abdali defeated the
Marathas at Paniplat. The Afghans had been in control of much of the
Empire for some time but were unable to make the most of their victory
and returned to Kabul. However they did invade the Empire a number of
times during the 18th Century.
The Persians under Nadir Shah captured much of the Empire’s wealth
and returned home with gold, jewels and the Peacock throne from Delhi.
Aurangzeb often showed intolerance to non-Muslims. He introduced a tax
on non-Muslims called the Jizya. During Aurangzeb’s reign, some Hindu
temples were destroyed and some limits were placed on Hindu practices.
Taxation was high as because of the costs of military campaigns such as
the Deccan Wars and building luxurious palaces. Because of these he
became an unpopular ruler.
Maratha guerrilla fighters defeated a Mughal army in 1737 and took
control of Delhi and eastwards towards Bengal. By 1760 they were the
most powerful group in India and the Mughals were unable to limit their
expansion.
The British expansion into the subcontinent was rapid, overwhelming the
Mughal forces and equipment."
2017,Section B,General History,3 (a) How did the name ‘Pakistan’ originate?,4,"Chaudhry Rehmat Ali devised the name.

2017,Section B,General History,(b) Why was the Second Round Table Conference of 1931 unsuccessful?,7,"Gandhi did not accept that the 14 Points of the Quaid-e-Azam should be
included in future discussions.
Gandhi did not accept the demands about the rights of minorities.
The Conference was unsuccessful because Gandhi refused to recognise
the rights of the Muslim."
2017,Section B,Mughal Empire,(c) Was the withdrawal of Gandhi’s support the most important reason for the decline of the Khilafat Movement? Explain your answer.,14,"Gandhi saw an opportunity for self-rule by joining the Movement, the
involvement of a Hindu-majority grouping was welcomed by many
Muslims.
By joining with a Hindu-majority grouping the objectives of the Movement
were made less clear. Some perceived that Gandhi and some Hindus and
used it for their own political reasons.
Chauri Chaura was a village in the United Province where trouble started
between the police and a mob. Gandhi decided that the Swaraj Movement
was becoming too violent following the Chauri Chaura incident and so
withdrew his support.
Other reasons
Thousands of Muslims migrated to Afghanistan in a religious protest
against the British government. The Afghan government was hostile to the
migrants and refused to allow all the refugees to settle.
Many of the refugees who returned to India died on the journey back or
found themselves homeless and their jobs occupied which dispirited them.
Some of the leaders including Maulana and Muhammad Ali were
imprisoned in 1921 which made the organisation less effective.
The refusal of Britain to accept the demands of the Movement.
The decision of the Mustafa Kamal Ataturk to form a nationalist
government in Turkey ended most of the impetus for the Khalifat
movement, which had previously served as a unifying force for Muslims.
Mopla violence divided Muslims. "

2017,Section B,Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto,(b) Explain why Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s rule ended in 1977.,7,"The focal point of political power lay with the party leadership and with
Bhutto in particular, so when things went wrong he was blamed.
The changes in education were criticised as they led to overcrowding in
existing schools whilst new ones were built/the building of new schools/
the recruitment of new teachers could not be achieved quickly/was very
expensive.
Many families resented the educational reforms because it meant a loss
of earnings for them.
Opponents alleged that Bhutto and his party manipulated the election in
March 1977, which led to protests that were put down by the police.
Martial law was imposed in Karachi, Lahore and Hyderabad and strikes by
bus and truck drivers in Karachi (Operation Wheel Jam), caused further
problems for Bhutto.
During Bhutto’s time in office the economy declined which contributed to
unrest and reduced support for his government."
2017,Section B,General History,(c) Which of the following contributed the most to Pakistan’s domestic policies between 1948 and 1958?,14,"Khwaja Nazimuddin:

power, industry and transport. It was important to the economic

constitutional development could take place because of these challenges.
He resigned in 1955 due to ill health.
Iskander Mirza:
Became acting Governor General in 1955.

weapons, and would not give aid to Pakistan, stating Pakistan was in
contravention of the 1985 Pressler Amendment. The USA had promised
$4 million in an economic package to help Pakistan to refurbish their
military forces.

USA.
The Pakistan government expressed concerns about the status of India
as a nuclear power. "
2017,Section B,Independence and Partition,(c) To what extent was the relationship between Pakistan and its neighbour Afghanistan successful from 1947 to 1999?,14,"During Zahir Shah’s time in office relations between Afghanistan and
Pakistan were friendly and during the 1965 War remained neutral despite
pressure from other powers.
There were good relations when an Islamic foreign policy was introduced,
leading to visits between both countries by Bhutto and later Zia-ul-Haq
and Daud in 1970’s.
There was humane treatment in Pakistan of Afghan refugees following
outbreak of Afghan–Russian War. Afghanistan had territorial claims to part of the North West Frontier
Province (NWFP) following establishment of Pakistan in 1947.
Afghanistan voted against Pakistan joining UN in 1947.
Afghanistan did not always adhere to a trade agreement with Pakistan; Diplomatic relations between the two countries were withdrawn in 1955
but later renewed.
During the Afghan–Russian War, planes entered Pakistani airspace and

After the war, law and order was hard to restore in Afghanistan; problems

kidnappings and gun battles between rival gangs.
There was an increase in Islamic militancy following support given to the
Taliban in Afghanistan."
